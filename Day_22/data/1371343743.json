Have fun with this.\r\rHere's mine: \rWake up in the morning; coffee. I need it. So many different people and articles want to tell me what to eat, what not to eat, and when to eat when I should, but can I just drink my damn coffee? My body wants to go back to sleep, and my brain is planning out my day; they don't speak the same language. Coffee is my translator. It takes the intentions of my brain, tells them to my body, and brings peace to my soul. It is the perfect trifecta. Maybe I'll need another cup later, maybe it'll make me tired by the time I get home, but maybe I would have even gotten out of bed if I didn't have any. \r\rSo what now? Despite the warnings, I've had my coffee. Knowing the repercussions, I still enjoyed every drop. I basked in the heat of it's fumes and found myself in place with clear thoughts, a place that seemed distant before. This is me. The zombie that needs the alarm, and the coffee made fresh every morning, joined into one being, one person, capable of tackling life. Sometimes when I drink too much, it feels like I can pick life up, but I never do. I have responsibilities, I have a job, can I really sacrifice all of that for a chance at life? Maybe you can, but that's not me. As long as I have my coffee, that's all I need. ",

Another (pre-med) sent longer emails between a primary care physician, patient, and cardiac specialist concerning a heart transplant. \n\nI'll try to look for my own, but essentially I wrote about a small group of college graduate students cooperating over research with their department professor. He would email the students together and they would then discussed his communications through email or text. Being Graduates within a small program, they also discussed each other intimately.\n\nI remember enjoying my work after completing it, something rare as I'm just starting out. It tested various group dynamics and juxtaposed clearly different personalities. I'll look for it and try to submit if I can find it.\n\n-best of luck. \n\n**e:** also ps. I remember the reason for gathering the records. One of the students in the group (as the story would have continued) died, and they had been collected to establish whereabouts, personalities, and responsibility in a fictional suit against the university.\n\n^\nThat's why I thought the idea was so interesting.",

            "selftext": "**I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ACADEMY...**\n\nGood news, everybody! We've hit the **10,000 SUBSCRIBER MARK!**\n\nOh, what a happy day. The five digit mark has been reached. This subreddit has existed for well over two years. However, when it started and for a year or so afterwards, the subscriber count stayed at about 33. I found the subreddit on July 22nd and was dismayed at how dead it was. I sent a message to the creator (LouY, who deleted his account many months ago) and asked if I could take over. He relinquished all controls. I had one goal in mind for the following year: To get at least 1,000 subscribers into the fold of writing. I am so pleased that we've hit that number ten-fold in well under one year of \"new management.\"\n\nThere are quite a few people to thank for the growth, nurturing and inspiration of the community.\n\nObviously, the mods - /u/SurvivorType, /u/202halffound, /u/sakanagai, /u/lordmalifico, /u/AA_AgonistAgent.\n\nThey are all wonderful and for different reasons. You can see the short interview we had with /r/subredditoftheday here:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/1f6s3b/may_28th_2013_rwritingprompts_the_ultimate_test/\n\nWhich is just one of the ways in which our subscriber count grew. As well as having quite a few highly upvoted /r/bestof posts. In fact, our subreddit was one of the [prime reasons /r/bestof eliminated default subreddits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/y3ufx/rbestof_results_of_the_no_defaults_experiment/)\n\nThis has been such an awesome almost-first-year. We've got a lot of things planned for the coming months. NaNoWriMo prep, for example, is fast approaching. Some of you participated last year. I hope more of you join in this year. The weekly critique thread is quite popular (and was forgone this week in light of the 10k mark approaching, and because I haven't finished critiquing everyone from last week yet.) We will be testing out allowing links in the near future and, well, a lot of other fun stuff. Also, look forward to the third lesson either today or tomorrow. I will also be uploading more pulp sci-fi in smaller chunks for the users who requested it as part of the second lesson.\n\nCheers!\n\n-----------\n\n**JULY CONTEST ANNOUNCEMENT**\n\nIt has been a while since we've had a contest. The prize of which is $25 (You can choose to get that via PayPal or virtual Amazon Gift Card.) You will also be able to get three months of Reddit gold. That's the most important bit, right? The prize?\n\n*The Prompt*: Your character is a desperate homeless person. They need to somehow secure $10,000 in a day to save an estranged family member. How do they get the money? How did their family member get into such a situation? What is the resolution?\n\n*Instructions*: As with the previous contests, submit your works with the title \"[PI] TITLE OF YOUR STORY - July Contest\". You have until July 31st 11:59PM PST to submit your story. If you have issue with it not showing up under \"NEW\", please contact the mods with a link to the submission on Reddit so we can approve it. You can edit it however much you like up until the deadline, take any criticisms people make to help you if you wish. You may not submit your work to any weekly writing critique threads until after the contest has ended.\n\nHave fun and happy writing!\n\n-----------\n\n**OTHER FESTIVITIES**\n\n- Expect a bunch of prompts related to the number 10,000.\n- The aforementioned third writingprompts lesson / prompt.\n- Free beer (provided by SurvivorType)\n- Fun chat times in the chatroom! Click on the sidebar to the right to access the chatroom. Even mobile devices have an IRC app, so you can join us!\n\nThanks again for subscribing. The stuff all of you have been writing has been spectacular.\n\nCheers!",
