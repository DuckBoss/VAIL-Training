Writing a scenario where the reader *thinks* they know what's going on, but then there's the old switcheroo at the end that turns the whole thing on its end. To come up with a random example off the top of my head: Imagine a man scaling a building. He's dressed all in black and he breaks into an apartment. The reader thinks: It's a criminal committing a crime. Now imagine the reader finds out that he was just a highly motivated party planner who was hired to setup a surprise party, but lost the key and had to break in through the 10 story window. (Then he gets shot because he broke into the wrong apartment. Yes, this was the premise of a short story I wrote years ago as part of this very exercise.)\n\nSo, your writing mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a short piece where it seems like the character(s) is(are) doing something, but then it turns into something else entirely.",

Have it generate a list of FIVE items.

The room is almost empty, except for four objects/things. What do those four things mean?\n\nYou can make this any genre you want: Horror, romance, mystery, thriller, your choice!

The country with the largest population gets the largest space, and vice versa.\n\n&gt;I'd love to read a novel about the ramifications of this actually happening. Everyone in the world wakes up in a different country. Even if you assumed everyone tried to get back to their real country, moving 7 billion people would take years, or decades. People would largely have to just settle in, as they waited for the huge travel backlog to work through.\n\n&gt;It would be similar to a survival or dystopian story, people just trying to stay alive, but instead of decimating the world (aliens attack, nuclear holocaust, zombies etc) you leave the world untouched, and just move the people, arguably creating a more devastating effect.\n\nIn general, looking at this map really sparked my imagination, hope it does the same for you. Cheers!\n\nEdit - Many thanks everyone, these were extremely interesting to read, I love the different interpretations people took.",

            "selftext": "It\u2019s a typical Tuesday night. I\u2019m at Melissa\u2019s house, tutoring her in physics. She has her own place and, as usual, we are both sitting on her living room couch pouring over her latest physics homework on the coffee table. The table is cluttered with papers and drinks, a jacket and a little model car that must belong to her boyfriend. At this exact moment, she is complaining about her homework. Not surprisingly, she\u2019s having trouble discerning the difference between chaotic and deterministic systems.  In her defense though, I would have trouble learning just about anything if I was sitting on the most God-awful maroon and baby-blue floral print couch. She looks up from the piles of paper and pictures to ask me to explain it (for the umpteenth time) in terms she can understand. This might prove difficult, but I try, yet again, to elucidate to her that chaos hinges on the ability for small changes in the input to produce drastic changes in the output. That\u2019s an important thing to remember. In essence, it\u2019s the Butterfly Effect. She nods her little blonde head along slowly, but I think we both know she doesn\u2019t get it. \n\n\n\u201cChaos happens because, as much as we try, we can never successfully predict what is going to happen,\u201d I explain. \n\n\n\u201cOk... but that\u2019s not true. We can predict the weather,\u201d she retorts. I can\u2019t tell if she is being sincere in her response or if she\u2019s just trying to be argumentative.\n\n\n\u201cAhh, but can we predict the weather more than, say a week out,\u201d I ask, hoping she won\u2019t actually answer. \u201cNo, we can\u2019t. Not successfully at least. The best weather systems in the world can\u2019t determine how the weather will act a month out with one hundred percent certainty.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd that is because?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBecause too many things happen that can change it. Any little thing can drastically affect the outcome of an event.\u201d\n\n\nAn exasperated sigh. \n\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand how I\u2019ll ever need any of this,\u201d she complains. \n\n\nAs she releases another obnoxious exhale, she rolls her eyes to convey the message that both deterministic systems and I are boring. I stand up from the couch and turn to face her.\n\n\n\u201cWhat you don\u2019t understand is that this is everywhere!\u201d I spread my arms out as I say \u201ceverywhere,\u201d but instead of illustrating my point, all I do is knock over a cup of juice and the toy car onto the floor. She yelps and lunges to try and catch it. Fail. It spills all over her carpet. \n\n\n\u201cAha! See, we never could have predicted that would happen!\u201d\n\n\nInstead of acknowledging my wit, she just growls some cuss words and looks up at me.\n\n\n\u201cThanks, Jude. Go get paper towels, please.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNevermind,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll use this\u201d. She pulls her blue sweater over her head, revealing a pretty... well... revealing shirt underneath. With a flimsy white top, I could easily understand why she was wearing a sweater. I wouldn\u2019t wear that out in public. What would you call that exactly? A bandeau? \n\n\nShe\u2019s on her hands and knees in front of me, cussing away, trying to soak up the juice so it doesn\u2019t stain the carpet. I\u2019m about to bend down and help her when a booming voice announces it\u2019s presence from behind me.\n\n\u201cWhat the fuck is going on,\u201d it explodes out.\n\n\nI turn to face the largest, hulking, giant of a beast I have ever seen: Melissa\u2019s boyfriend. My face is completely white: partly because I never heard him open the door, and partly because he is a terrifying human being. His mohawk gave him another six inches of height on his already 6\u20192\u201d body. He had tattoos on his neck and arms, which were clearly visible due to the fact that his denim shirt had its sleeves torn off. He had, what I\u2019m pretty sure was a Confederate flag bandana in the back of his oil-stained jeans, and I\u2019m almost positive you would have trouble fitting tires over his biceps. In fact, I think one of the tattoos on his arm mentioned how he was a \u201cstrong mo\u2019 fucka\u201d. Fitting.\n\n\nWith perfect timing, Melissa leans out from behind me, still on her knees, to greet her fuming boyfriend.\n\n\n\u201cWhy the fuck are you yelling\u201d she yells back.\n\n\n\u201cI come home with you on your knees, and you\u2019re wearing a bra in front of this jerk. Why do you think I\u2019m fucking yelling?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bandeau,\u201d I correct him. The words escape my mouth before I can stop them and I instantly regret talking. That little comment is going to produce some negative results, I predict.\n\n\nHe takes a step towards me and lowers his head to closer match my pathetic height. I can feel his heated nostril breath on my face.\n\n\n\u201cWhat did you just say, bro,\u201d he growls out.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bandeau?\u201d\n\n\nHe glares at me in silence for a moment before he continues.\n\n\n\u201cIf you want a problem, I can give you a problem.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. That is the opposite of what I want.\u201d\n\n\nHe tightens his fists at his side.\n\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t doing anything, Trent,\u201d Mel yells from behind me.\n\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he shouts back. \u201cIt looks like you weren\u2019t doing anything. Tell me, do you not do anything with other guys too?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t even make sense,\u201d she screams back.\n\n\n They\u2019re yelling at each other and I take this opportunity to take small footsteps towards the door. I think that in all this rage my absence would hardly be noticed.\n\n\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going,\u201d the big man thunders as he pushes me back. His one hand pushing me produced enough force to send me tumbling backwards over the table landing on my back.  Melissa screams and the guy stomps over to me. He picks me up with both hands by my my shirt, and holds me off the ground so that only the tips of my toes can barely scratch against the carpet.\n\n\n\u201cYou come into my house? You mess around with my girl?\u201d\n\n\nMelissa is futilely pounding hers fists against his gargantuan back.\t\n\n\n\u201cLet him go, you oaf! We weren\u2019t doing anything,\u201d she screams.\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t messing around with her, I swear! She\u2019s not even my type.\u201d Maybe not the best choice in words.\n\n\nHe raises an eyebrow and then tightens his grip on my shirt.\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that supposed to mean, huh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUh... I mean... she\u2019s attractive...\u201d\n\n\nHis fists tighten and he raises me higher into the air. I\u2019m glad there isn\u2019t a ceiling fan. That would be just a gratuitous amount of violence.\n\n\n\u201c...but, I mean... I just... I would never. I mean, maybe if she was single...\u201d\n\n\nHe throws me on the ground and right before he is about to kick my head in, Melissa jumps in front of him. \n\n\n\u201cStop it, Trent! Just stop it! Jude and I weren\u2019t doing anything! I wouldn\u2019t ever even consider doing anything with him.\u201d\t\n\n\nI\u2019m hurt. Both my back and my pride. I think I landed on something too. Maybe it was that stupid Hotwheels car.\n\n\n\u201cI saw you two though. Don\u2019t lie to me,\u201d he barks at her before he bends down to pick me up again.\n\n\nI\u2019m lifted (rather uncomfortably) by my hair and the back of my collar until I\u2019m on my feet.\n\n\n\u201cIf you want a fight, man, you can have a fight.\u201d\n\n\n\nI stand up straight and he pushes me back a little. I stumble back a couple feet. I\u2019m panicking. What am I going to do? This guy could kill a buffalo if he wanted. He\u2019s crazy.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna fucking murder you.\u201d\n\n\nHe takes a step towards me and I raise my arms in front of my face and slam my eyes shut, terrified of what is about to come. Instead of a smashing sensation in my facial area, all I hear is a cry for help and a thundering smash. I cautiously open one of my eyes and lower my hands. The Beast is unconscious. His girlfriend is screaming and crying. What the heck just happened?\n\n\n\u201cOh my God! Get help,\u201d she yells up to me. She\u2019s on her knees next to her mister.\n\n\n\u201cWhat just happened?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe slipped! Oh my God! Call 9-1-1, please, Jude.\u201d She\u2019s sobbing now. It\u2019s no longer crying. There is torrent of snot, mascara and tears streaming down her face and onto the forehead of her crumpled boyfriend.\n\n\nI look down at them. He\u2019s lying on his back, with his head leaning against the coffee table. I guess when he had slipped and fallen backwards and cracked the back of his head on the table. Now he\u2019s unconscious. Ha! That\u2019s what you get for being a bully.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t just stand there. Do something,\u201d she yells at me.\n\n\nSo I do. I grab my physics book off the couch and put on my jacket. \n\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She stares up at me.\n\n\nAs I\u2019m zipping up, I notice a little toy car against the far wall. So that\u2019s what he had slipped on.\n\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d she repeats.\n\n\n\nI walk over to the car and pick it up. The car in my palm makes me smile. Such a small car brought down such a large man. A car that wasn\u2019t supposed to be where it was sitting anyways. Ahh, the irony. \n\n\n\nI turn to face the couple as the boyfriend slowly opens his eyes. Groggy and wincing, he looks up at his girlfriend, back at me, and then back at his girlfriend.\n\n\n\u201cWhat happened here,\u201d he moans.\n\n\nI walk towards him and place the car neatly on his chest.\n\n\n\n\u201cChaos.\u201d\n",

Either via the web [by clicking here](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=WritingPrompts) - or through any IRC chat program (which exists on phones, computers, tablets, etc.) by going to irc.freenode.net and typing /join #writingprompts\n\n--------------\n\n**JAN 2013 CONTEST**\n\n**PROMPT**: The climax. You are to dream up a story. It can be about anything in particular. Write the big scene of the story. The most salacious, or action packed, or dramatic, or... you get the idea. This will be the most free form prompt we have.\n\n**WORD LIMIT**: There is no word limit. However, if it exceeds the amount one can put in a reddit post (10,000 characters) you ought to host it elsewhere like Google Docs.\n\n**PRIZE/ENTRY DEADLINE/ENTERING**: The entry deadline is Jan 31st at 11:59 PST. Voting will begin sometime on February 1st. When submitting, do not do so as a reply here. create a new post with this format:\n\n- [PI] \"TITLE OF YOUR WORK\" - JAN. CONTEST\n\nThis will make sure that your entry does not get overlooked come voting time. Only those who participate will be allowed to vote. The voting phase lasts one week to give everyone time to read the others works. The prize is $20 Paypal OR Amazon.com virtual gift card.\n\nBe sure to check if your post goes through by checking the \"NEW\" filter (sorted by NEW) after you post. If you find it's been autofiltered, send a message to the moderators. You can edit your entry however much you like up until the deadline, take any criticisms people make to help you if you wish.\n\n**WHY SO FREEFORM?**: I feel that January is great for the start of something larger. Sometimes writing the most climactic piece of your work can be like building a foundation. You're excited about the fact you've got the bones down, now you will want to work up the muscle, flesh and other parts of the body.\n\nI look forward to all entries. Happy writing!",
