            "selftext": "###Welcome to Get to Know a Mod!\n\nWelcome to the Wednesday post. This will be posted **bi-weekly**, alternating with the Writing Workshops.\n\nThis is going to be quite like the Mod Q&amp;amp;A, where you ask the questions, but only one mod answers them. You may ask any question you'd like towards a mod, whether it'd be about writing or about their favorite pizza topping. You can also prompt the mod if they're willing.\n\nIf there are any questions about these posts or the workshops, you can either PM /u/Arch15, or message the moderators. \n\n----\n\n##Today's Featured Mod: /u/Gurahave!\n\n**Prompts: Please give me as many as you like! I've been a delinquent for far too long. You might have to wait for responses, though...**\n\n * Favorite Genre to write?\n\nThis is a tricky one to answer. I love so many. I'm a big fan of urban fantasy, realistic fiction, magical realism, and psychological work. It's not a genre per se, but I also like to explore stream of consciousness and mix it in with the genres I mentioned. \n\n * Favorite Pastime?\n\nAside from writing, I'd have to say pretty much anything related to music strikes my fancy. I love listening to concerts, singing opera, composing and arranging, and playing Yakety Sax on my (you guessed it) sax. \n\n * Favorite food?\n\nCheese stuffed Italian shells. No, enchiladas. No, home made pizza. Mashed potatoes! Chocolate lava cake! Mushroom moussaka! Eggnog cheesecake! Can I settle and say I like all food that is vegetarian? Except tempeh....\n\n* Would you rather be the famous author of Twilight or the famous writer of every Nickelback song? \n\nWho would ask such an inhumane question? I suppose I'd rather be the author of Twilight? Twelve year old me sort of enjoyed the first one, so there has to be some merits in it... Otherwise, I can use my fame to release somewhat good literature. There's no redemption in Nickelback. \n\n----\n\n**Rules:**\n\n * Be respectful, and follow the rules of the subreddit. ***No personal attacks.* They will be removed without hesitation and without notice.**\n * A mod answer has the right to reveal as much as they feel comfortable. \n * Sometimes the mod doesn't have enough time to write a reply right away, so don't take it personally if they do not have the opportunity to reply right away.\n\n**Ask away!**",

We\u2019ll be taking turns, three or four at a time, writing responses to any prompts that get posted \u2013 you can see a schedule below of who is writing and when (although writers may jump in at other points too if they see a story they like). \n\nWe\u2019re asking you to post us prompts in the comments below - they can be festive or not and can be any kind of prompt - normal writing prompts, image prompts, EU prompts, media prompts, anything! \n\nIf we get lots of prompts then we'll try and do as many as possible, but may keep the stories a little shorter than usual \u2013 if a writer really enjoys the story, then they might write more, or continue it later, it\u2019s entirely up to them. \n\nIf you have a favourite writer, then when it\u2019s their slot to write, feel free to tag them so they notice it and if they like to prompt and have a chance, then maybe they\u2019ll reply \u2013 if we get a lot of prompts though then we might not get to all of them, sorry! \n\nIf you enjoy the stories, then we\u2019d ask that instead of gold, you might consider giving to charity. Some of the writers have nominated a few charities, which I\u2019ll put below, but if you have your own favourite, then maybe consider a donation to them. \n\nThank you and have a Merry Xmas and a Happy [Hogmanay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogmanay) (New Years for non-Scottish people)!   \n&amp;nbsp;  \n**Writers**  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n\nGMT | Pacific | Mountain | Central | Eastern | Writer\n---|-------|--------|-------|-------|------\n17:00 | 09:00 | 10:00 | 11:00 | 12:00 | /u/schoolgirlerror, /u/LovableCoward, /u/IWasSurprisedToo, /u/pixeltalker\n19:00 | 11:00 | 12:00 | 13:00 | 14:00 | /u/Syraphia, /u/MajorParadox, /u/Luna_LoveWell, /u/fringly\n21:00 | 13:00 | 14:00 | 15:00 | 16:00 | /u/Draxagon, /u/The_Eternal_Void, /u/Idreamofdragons, /u/mo-reeseCEO1\n23:00 | 15:00 | 16:00 | 17:00 | 18:00 | /u/samgalimore, /u/JeniusGuy, /u/Writteninsanity\n01:00 | 17:00 | 18:00 | 19:00 | 20:00 | /u/Mega_Dunsparce, /u/Arch15, /u/SeanPenname, /u/brooky12\n03:00 | 19:00 | 20:00 | 21:00 | 22:00 | /u/Lexilogical, /u/ManEatingCatfish  \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n\n\n**Charities we support**  \n&amp;nbsp;  \n[British Red Cross Syrian Appeal](http://www.redcross.org.uk/Donate-Now/Make-a-single-donation/Syria-Crisis-Appeal)\n\n[The Trevor Project](http://www.thetrevorproject.org/section/donate)\n\n[Breast Cancer Research Foundation](http://www.bcrfcure.org/)\n\n[M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res](http://www.msf.org/donate)  \n\n&amp;nbsp;  \n  \n\nEDIT: Thank you to /u/schoolgirlerror, /u/LovableCoward, /u/IWasSurprisedToo, /u/pixeltalker - there are some amazing stories being posted!

            "selftext": "When I was young I could snap awake at the slightest sound. I would jump out of my bedroll, draw my sword, and be ready for what came next.\n\nI wasn't ready to wake up to Ruksana crouching by my cot. I reached for my knife, but she said, \"You taste good.\" \n\nHer eyes were huge and bright.\n\n\"Eh?\" I said.\n\nShe was gone from my tent.\n\nI pushed myself to a sitting position and stared where she'd been. There was a sniff of something warm, heavy, sour-sweet. Perfume.\n\n\"Goddamn,\" I said.\n\n* * * \n\nThe wind blew in the desert. It picked up sand and brought it along and the grains rasped upon the ground. The sand shuffled down the dunes and the sand skittered up the dunes. The dunes piled up. Sometimes they flowed like water. The wind hissed and howled. It picked up substance -- twirled them into whirlwinds -- and sent them dancing down the road. I'd see them out one eye and flinch. But they only spun past and into nothing. \n\nAfter almost a year of this, you'd think I'd have gotten used to it. But the landscape was as alien to me as it had been in the first weeks. We were well-used to the heat and the dust but none of us was ever comfortable.\n\nNothing lived, for one thing. There are other deserts, I'm told, but even they see rain on occasion. This allows them to support all manner of life.\n\nIt has never rained in the Great Desert. Not since gods conspired to turn it into a true wasteland. I never saw a cloud while I was there. Ruksana said we would not find water no matter how deep we dug. And this was an area the size of Europe.\n\nIn this climate a man needs at least a gallon a day. A horse, over ten times as much. And water is *heavy.* Only the Silk Road made travel possible.\n\n\"Strange sort of road,\" El Gato had said, when first we saw it. \"What could have made it?\"\n\nThe surface was honey-coloured and translucent. It looked like a frozen river except it was as hot as the sand. \n\n\"It's... solid glass,\" Reginald said. \"Like someone dug a trench and filled it with molten stuff.\"\n\n\"You're mostly right,\" I said. \"The road is the work of Zarathus the Torch-Bearer.\"\n\nActually one of his clerics could have done it, given time and divine favour.\n\n*\"... and he passed his hand over the desert, and the sand fused into glass, and the glass became a road,\"* I quoted. \"Damn considerate of him.\"\n\n\"There must be trade,\" Ruksana said. \"The gods knew that. The spice, and the silk, must flow.\"\n\n\"Luxuries,\" I said.\n\n\"Communication,\" she said. \"There are other civilizations out in the godless lands. We must stay in contact.\"\n\nThere were campsites a day's journey apart. Each campsite had a cistern full of the sweetest water I've tasted. This, too, was a gift from the gods. Or maybe their hydraulic engineers.\n\n\"But see, the cisterns empty quickly and replenish slowly,\" Ruksana had said. \"A caravan can use them, but not an army.\"\n\n\"Good thing we're not an army,\" I said. \n\n* * * \n\nWe travelled in the morning and early evening, when the winds were somewhat cool and the light was not a weight upon our backs. We trudged down the yellow road that the winds swept clean. When the sun was high we found shade (or we threw some together) and we waited out the midday heat. Every day the same relentless heat. We would have been as baked as the landscape if we hadn't adopted caravan dress, loose woollen robes of blue and black. These kept the heat out, kept the air flowing so we were only lightly broiled. We wore hoods also and covered our faces against the parching winds.\n\nAt night it was freezing. Then we pulled our robes close and slept warm. \n\n\n* * * \n\nI had been concerned about travelling through the desert with Ruksana. On the continent she had satisfied her blood-thirst with the occasional bandit. But the Silk Road was lacking in bandits. Or anyone else really. Caravans took care not to meet because doing so would mean dry wells in either direction.\n\nIf water was precious, blood was even more so. I watched her closely on the road and closer still when we happened into town. Some of these places, the worst you could find was a man who beat his daughters. It angered me, of course, but not enough to leave him to the harpy. \n\nSo I guarded Ruksana. My arm was scarred from our encounter but it was like it never happened to her. Sometimes she helped Mona with the cooking, or Eirik with the horses. Sometimes she sat with Valerie for lessons in reading and reckoning. A bit of a teacher, our harpy. She'd tried to teach the dogmen but Lady was the only one who'd learned.\n\nThe others knew never to leave Rory alone with Ruksana. The baby was turning into a happy toddler, crawling everywhere in camp. Bird-girl seemed not to notice. \n\nMonths passed and nothing happened. In hindsight, I should've delegated.\n\n* * * \n\nIn the mornings we shook out our boots. Ruksana said it was unnecessary but my training had saved me many times. The habit remained. \n\n* * *\n\nThe wind keened. The wind sighed. Against this, the rustle and clank of horses and men. We were an island of familiar noise in a sea of mindless sound. \n\n* * * \n\nOr maybe not. Sometimes I heard laughter.\n\n* * * \n\nWhen it was hot the dunes would shimmer and jump. When it \nwas windy the dunes threw themselves in our faces. El Gato muttered constantly about sand and how he hated it.\n\n* * * \n\nTrudging through that vastness, it seemed the journey would go on forever. If it weren't for our lengthening beards we'd have no way of knowing whether time still existed.\n\n\n* * * \n\nThe sunsets were lovely.\n\n* * *\n\nI sat on the camp stool with a sheet draped over me.\n\n\"This one is glad you are doing this,\" El Gato said. \"You were starting to get really hairy.\"\n\n\"Hrm,\" I said. \"This from the fur-ball.\"\n\nEl Gato scratched his chin. \"In fact, the three of you are starting to look like a beard-themed musical group,\" \n\nI lifted my head. Eirik brushed on the lather and Reginald produced the straight razor. There are advantages to having a squire and blacksmith in your party.\n\n\"And Reginald!\" El Gato said. \"Your beard is as large as you are!\"\n\n\"Would you like your whiskers trimmed?\" the dwarf asked him. \"Because that could be arranged.\"\n\nEirik brought the razor to my cheek. His hands trembled and I flinched. I said nothing. It wouldn't help his nerves. \n\nHe did a good enough job on the first pass. I wiped the soap off and he applied fresh lather.\n\n\"Good morning,\" Ruksana said. \n\nEirik jumped. I frowned -- he had nicked my chin.\n\n\"Ruksana,\" I said. \"Don't you know better than to sneak up on a shaving man?\"\n\nI turned to her, blood trickling from the cut. I found her staring at my face. Her eyes burned and she started forward. \n\nEl Gato clapped a towel over my head, covering it completely. \n\n\"Is there something you wanted?\" he asked.\n\nRuksana had halted. \"Er, yes. Mona says breakfast is ready.\"\n\n\"We'll be there,\" I said, through the cloth on my face. \"Was there anything else?\"\n\n\"Ah, no. Not a thing.\" \n\nShe turned and left.\n\n\"... Well!\" I said. \"That could have been messy.\"\n\n\"Quite,\" Reginald said.\n\n\"New rule: Do not bleed in front of her,\" I said. \"At least not until I've dealt with her bloodlust.\"\n\n\"How will you do that?\" Eirik asked. *\"... also I'm very sorry about the cut...\"*\n\n\"Forget it,\" I said. \"As for the harpy, well. I'll think of something.\"\n\n\"Indeed you shall, Sir Ghost,\" El Gato said. \"Now, will you be having your back rub?\"\n\n* * * \n\nSoon after that she visited my tent and remarked on how good I tasted. Like an animal that's sampled human flesh, she must've turned man-eater just for me. \n\nDamnation.\n\nNow we were two predators circling outside the campfire's light. She would glance up from something and find me alert. I would turn and catch her watching. We would look each other up and down. She stepped lightly and her hands never fumbled. In a fight she would strike hard and fast. \n\nWhile I estimated her abilities, she was doing the same with me. She would lick her lips when she did, the beast. I was certain blood would spill, and soon.\n\n* * * \n\nNaturally I kept in fighting shape. We all did. There was time in the early morning when the day was yet cool.\n\nEirik and El Gato were sparring. There was the clatter-clash of sword and buckler. The small metal shields they held in front of them, flipping them over and under as they cut around them. \n\n\"Too many flourishes, El Gato,\" I said. \"And Eirik! Keep those hands close together!\"\n\nThey were getting good at this. The spare swords were as sharp as their usual weapons but I trusted them to stay safe. Right and left they circled, crashing their bucklers into each other. \n\nTheir swords touched. El Gato threw Eirik's point aside, stabbed at the boy's face. Eirik backed away and recovered his guard. My squire caught El Gato's point on his buckle and thrust forward, giving El Gato no choice but to parry. Their swords touched again. Eirik turned his wrist, testing the contact. Their bucklers jammed together and he cut at the ribs. I caught my breath.\n\nThe boy pulled his blow at the last moment. He and the cat-man shared a look. \n\nOn guard again. El Gato angled his sword down, pushing Eirik's sword with the flat of his blade. Eirik's hands went forward, sword and buckler a single weapon. His blade snaked under El Gato's and cut for the temple. El Gato raised his buckler and cut underneath. \n\n\"Stances, people!\" I said.\n\nEirik settled his legs. El Gato dug his toes in the sand. The two men shuffled and circled. They broke apart. They spiralled in. El Gato thrust up with both hands and Eirik batted his sword away with the buckler-rim. El Gato swung his own buckler, knocked the boy's blade aside. He cut at Eirik's thigh. The blow stopped an inch from the leg.\n\nThe two men nodded. \n\nEl Gato's sword flicked up, then crossed under his buckler and flicked underneath. Eirik gave ground. El Gato wound his blade around Eirik's and threatened the boy's face. \n\n\"Take a break, boys,\" I said. Eirik and El Gato reached for their waterskins. I took a long drink from mine. \n\nIn the distance the dogmen laughed. They were shooting at a sand dune. Reginald was with them, practising his crossbow.\n\n\"Fancy a bout, Siegebreaker?\"\n\nRuksana was smiling up at me. \n\nI looked at her.\n\nI shrugged. \"With wasters, sure.\"\n\nWe took up wooden longswords. They weren't as good for training as the real thing but I wasn't about to risk an accident in front of her.\n\n\"Do you trust me?\" she asked.\n\nShe stepped toward me, jabbing the point at my chest. I batted her sword aside and threatened her with my own point.\n\n\"We're sparring, aren't we?\" I said.\n\nShe sidestepped and threw her blade over mine. I took it on the knuckles. I grimaced and cut at her temple. She met my blade but I reversed my swing to cut from the other side. \n\nThe blow never landed. I stopped it.\n\n\"How real do you want this to be?\" I growled.\n\n\"As real as you like,\" she said. \"I've seen you watching me.\"\n\n\"You're dangerous,\" I said. \n\n\"And you aren't?\" she said.\n\nI wound my sword around hers, her weak to my strong. She gave way but only to angle for a strike. I cut down and she slashed left. Then she aimed for my shoulder. I parried, reaching with my off hand to disarm. She retreated. I cut under and she hit my hands.\n\n\"Damn!\" I said.\n\n\"You're so tall,\" she said. \"It's all I can reach.\"\n\nTrue enough, I had the height advantage. But she was faster. Her sword would lick out to intercept mine, attacking and defending in a stroke. I would make a cut, she'd undo it, and I'd give ground. \n\n\"I see you've mastered the longsword,\" I said.\n\n\"Not really,\" she said. \"Like you, I prefer one-handed weapons.\"\n\n\"Could've fooled me,\" I said, and avoided a cut.\n\n\"We have one-handed wasters too,\" she said. \"You chose these.\"\n\n\"One does not reveal one's fighting style to the enemy.\"\n\n\"Am I still the enemy?\" she asked. \"After all this time?\"\n\nShe swung at me but I met her blade and turned my cut into a stab. She pulled back into a guard and prepared to thrust.\n\n\"Nothing personal,\" I said. \"But a secret technique isn't as useful if it's no longer secret.\"\n\nI had taught them to Eirik and El Gato, but I didn't mention that.\n\nWe sparred in silence, blades reaching across the distance, flicking out to cut or counter-cut. When they made contact we read each other's intent through blade pressure. She stepped around me and swung at my scalp. Only turning my head saved me. I started to half-sword but she crashed into me, got a leg behind me, and pushed me into the ground. I tried to rise but she fell on me.\n\n\"I yield,\" I said, before she could ask. \n\nShe pushed herself up and looked at me. \"So soon?\"\n\n\"I'm embarrassed enough as it is.\"\n\n\"I'm Lilit's champion,\" she said. \"Don't forget.\"\n\nShe patted me on the cheek. \"Clean-shaven. I like that.\"\n\n* * * \n\nFor the rest of the day I was too befuddled to be much good. Yscyigg's blood, what did that woman *want?*\n\n* * *\n\n\"Ruksana?\" I said. \"I've come to talk.\"\n\n\"Come in.\"\n\n\"I hear splashing.\"\n\n\"I'm doing laundry.\"\n\nIn her *tent?* That was odd, but I stepped inside. She was nude, kneeling, and washing the feathers on her head. Her skin was glistening wet.\n\n\"A bucket bath was all I could manage,\" she said. \"I wanted to smell good for you.\"\n\n\"I -- I -- that is, I --\"\n\n\"Do paladins take vows of chastity?\" she wondered. \"Surely you've seen a naked woman. Come here.\"\n\nShe reached for me, but I stumbled out into the night.\n\n* * * \n\nLater, though, I couldn't sleep. Paladins aren't celibate. It's understood that our duties do not leave room for other commitments. That hasn't stopped some of us from retiring. Some of us have even raising families. It didn't happen often, but it did happen.\n\nThe same could be said for my relations with women. \n\nThis was the sort of thing Yscyigg would chuckle over, but He had been silent since we entered the desert. I gathered it was the same with Lilit and Ruksana.\n\nThat harpy. What was I doing, twisting in my bunk thinking of her? What I wanted was a glass of wine, or maybe a smoke. I was sitting up in bed when she pulled open the tent flap.\n\n\"Ruksana,\" I said.\n\n\"Siegebreaker.\"\n\nAnd then she was kissing me. She smelled like flowers and musk. Her breath was sweet. Hot upon my cheek. I didn't kiss back, not at first, but her lips were everywhere. First my lips, my chin, my jawline, then my chin again.\n\n\"Stop that,\" I said, and kissed her.\n\nShe was straddling me, bare thighs peeking through her robe. She was naked underneath and grinding herself into me. Her fingers kneaded the muscles of my back. They pulled her closer.\n\n\"No, stop,\" I said.\n\nKissing.\n\n\"I said stop,\" I said, and plunked her onto the bed.\n\nShe opened her legs, then pressed them together. \"Are we in a hurry?\"\n\n\"How do I know I won't wake up tomorrow, drained of blood?\"\n\nShe grinned. \"Oh, you'll be drained.\"\n\n\"This isn't reassuring.\"\n\nWe were both whispering for some reason.\n\n\"How do I know you aren't warming me up to eat?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't play with my food,\" she said, and slid into my lap. She wiggled her bottom. \"Hello. *Someone* is awake.\"\n\n\"Ruksana, I--\"\n\n\"Shh,\" she said, and trailed cooling kisses down my cheek. Something landed on the back of my neck and I tensed. But it was only a scarf. A pair of scarves, actually.\n\nShe pushed herself to her feet. She brought her hands to her robe and paused. The fingers were just touching her collar.\n\nShe slipped the fingers in and eased them down. First one hand, then the other. The robe parted. A bit of fabric hung on one nipple and fell away, revealing her left breast. Her fingers tugged down and the robe came open and undone. \n\nI swallowed. They were small breasts, with brown nipples. The left one was just a bit larger. They rose and fell with her breathing. Ruksana traced a hand across her robe, covering them for a moment. The fingers pulled off one sleeve, then the other. The blue robe settled like a curtain, baring her shoulders, her arms, the soft swell of her belly. The fabric clung to her hips. It hung from her wrists. She held the robe closed where her legs began.\n\nShe leaned down and kissed me. \"From now on, you'll have to kiss for both of us.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe straightened and posed like a Greek statue. \n\n\"Take one of the scarves,\" she said. \"Tie a knot in it.\"\n\nI slipped the gag into her mouth. She smiled at me as I tied it behind her neck. I tried to kiss her but she put a hand on my chest. She turned, brushing me with her wings, and then she let go the robe.\n\nThe cloth slipped off one buttock, then the other. She stepped out of it and looked at me over one shoulder. Her eyes were laughing. She twisted around, lamplight playing on her skin. I looked upon her body and became just a man.\n\nWith her back to me, she knelt onto the rug, legs wide enough to her bush. \n\nI looked at the second scarf in my hands.\n\nShe raised her arms and pressed her wrists together.\n\n* * * \n\n[**Patreon Tip Jar**](https://www.patreon.com/20150506?ty=h)\n\n[**Skrill Tip Jar**](/s \"chevalieromout716691@gmail.com\")\n\n[**Chapter 1**] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/34yua0/wp_what_doesnt_kill_me_has_made_a_tactical_error/cqzl6y8)\n\n[**Chapter 24**] (https://redd.it/3vmogq)\n\n[**Chapter 26**] (https://redd.it/40b2mn)",
