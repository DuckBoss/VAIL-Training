            "selftext": "Thanks to OP /u/BookWyrm17 for both writing the original prompt and for encouraging me to post a PI. \n\nIt took me a while to get my response online as life happened around me and it took a decent amount of time to write.  Also, I lack confidence so wasn't sure that submitting anything would be a great idea in the first place.\n\nAlso thanks to the /u/ in chat who found the prompt for me when I had lost it after 10 days.  I'm sorry I forgot your handle.\n\nAnyway.  Here's my take on Mages and using powers contrary to how they are perceived.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\nThey came for me.  As they swore they wouldn\u2019t.  As I told them they would.\n\n\nTwo magi, one tall, dark and screw-faced, the other petite and curvy, stood fifty feet away at the edge of my clearing looking worn and tired.  Only the ornate half-capes of the Mage-class hung brightly from their shoulders, retaining the bright colours of rank and station.  I could pick out the war-wizard tattoos scarring exposed skin.  More than fifty feet behind them, a bare handful of bedraggled horsemen sat on thin and wasted nags.  Even at this distance I could see the signs they had been living rough long in a semi-permanent state.  Their clothes were homespun and patched until the original garments were unrecognisable.  Their hair was either hacked short or long, greasy and matted. \n\nThey looked like they smelled.  Bad.\n\nI stood in the doorway of my cabin, a small, tidy place I had called home for the last nine years.  I had built it with my own hands with the practiced patience of someone who knew there was no where else to go and the thoroughness of someone sure they\u2019d be in the same spot for a long while.  I had felled the trees to form this clearing, turning the trees to timber and the once-dense forest into a large, grassy knoll. Noone could approach unseen.\n\n\nAt the edge of the clearing, the two Magi quickly conferred, the lanky man looked to be steeling himself, the woman, small and straight-backed was waving her hands emphatically, urging him on.  Finally, the darker mage took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and after kissing the other briefly on the cheek, turned and stepped beyond the safety of the woods.\n\nHe collapsed immediately.\n\nA murmur rippled through the mounted men, but they were wise enough to stay where they were.  The second figure cried out and leapt forward, realising they had stepped past the boundary mid-air, her shout changing from shock to despair and then to surprise all in the space of a breath.  I chuckled quietly, watching as one writhed in the dirt, the other landing awkwardly and freezing, surprised that they were unaffected.  Wide, blue eyes in a buttercup face looked up, first in horror, then confusion as realisation dawned on them.\n\n\n\u201cDin, let him up!\u201d she called out before bending down to help her compatriot.  I could hear the annoyance in her voice and smiled to myself.\n\n\nI eased up, or more accurately, I tightened my control, pulling my power closer to myself.  It was like squeezing a fist or tensing a muscle.  My kind exerted their power passively.  I could direct it, of course, but if I wasn\u2019t focusing, if I wasn\u2019t paying direct attention, my influence flowed outwards, claiming all within my range.  The two magi knew this, just as they knew the edge of the clearing wasn\u2019t just a place I had decided to stop chopping trees.\n\n\nIt was a warning.  One more step and you\u2019re mine.\n\n\nSo I clamped my teeth and pulled, straining to hold back, withdrawing my influence from the form still struggling to get up.  As soon as I withdrew a little he thrust away his friend and leapt up hissing and spitting like a cat.\n\n\nI loosened up.  He dropped.\n\n\n\u201cI can do this all day, Dick-skin,\u201d I called out, drawing away my power once more.\n\n\nHe looked up at me and pushed himself up more slowly this time, still angrily slapping away his partner\u2019s hands when she tried to help.  He was cursing under his breath, but I could still hear him.  He slipped into four different languages.  Hm.  That was new.  When did he learn to speak Urdu?\n\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t changed, Din,\u201d Elise called out, stepping past her friend\u2019s grumbling figure.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been nine years, Elise.  Of course I\u2019ve changed.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStill no control, I see,\u201d spat the other, stepping up beside the small, blonde mage.\n\n\n\u201cShut the fuck up, Dick-skin.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Dixon\u2019!\u201d Dick-skin shouted.\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact you\u2019re the skin off someone\u2019s dick.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact you still have no control.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally? Ask her how she\u2019s feeling.\u201d\n\n\nWe both looked at Elise. Her gaze turned inwards.  \u201cNothing,\u201d she said after a short time.  \u201cI can\u2019t feel him at all.\u201d\n\n\nI looked at Dick-skin, a sly smile spreading across my face.  \u201cThat\u2019s not what she said last time,\u201d\n\n\nDick-skin snarled.  I felt my hackles rise.  He was drawing on his power.  Static crackled across his furious eyes.  He didn\u2019t try anything.  He knew better.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a surprise that a snivelling maggot like you found your Other, Dick-skin,\u201d I growled.  An Other was a mage with the power opposite to yours.  The gods, in their infinite humour, saw fit to make it so that your power could not affect an Other.  So a Fire Mage, no matter how powerful, might be able to melt a mountain and torch a forest with nearly no effort, but their power had no effect on a Water Mage.\n\n\nOthers often ended up marrying or partnering in some way.  That way, any sudden lashing-out with powers in anger had no actual effect.  And sometimes you couldn\u2019t help letting go.  Say\u2026 during a nightmare, or during climax.  You used to hear stories of Earth Witches turning their partners to stone in the night over a bad dream, Rage Mages driving people insane with anger when drunk, or Light Mages blinding their sexual partners at the peak of coitus.  With light, I mean.  Not\u2026 you know.\n\n\nDixon growled, sparks spilling from his fingers and bolts of lightning crackling across his hands and arcing to the earth beneath him.  He struggled to pull himself under control.\n\n\n\u201cI mean, Storm Mages are common.  And Magma Magicians, too,\u201d I tipped an imaginary cap at Elise.  She smiled and bobbed a small curtsy.  \u201cBut what about your power to be an insufferable cock-weasel?\u201d\n\n\nElise stifled a laugh behind a frown. \u201cLuckily, I happen to be a glowing ray of sunshine.  Even in this, I am his complete opposite.\u201d\n\n\nDixon\u2019s brow furrowed even further, the tiny storm of lightning building as he struggled for calm.  He took a deep breath and let it out slowly, his power flowing from him in the same breath, his bolts grounding around him.\n\n\n\u201cWere,\u201d he growled through gritted teeth.\n\n\n\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d I quipped.  \u201cI\u2019ll need more information than that.  I don\u2019t speak rampant ignoramus.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWere common,\u201d he slumped, speaking quietly now.  \u201cStorm Mages WERE common.  Magma Magicians WERE plentiful.  As far as we know, we\u2019re the last.\u201d\n\n\nI scowled, all levity leaving me in a moment.  The Academy had once housed an entire wing of Storm Mages, a whole house solely for Magma Magicians.  For these to be the last two...\n\n\nI shook my head, lips tightening as I drew the last tendrils of my power away from Dixon.\n\n\n\u201cI told you\u2026\u201d I muttered.\n\n\n\u201cThings were so good,\u201d Dixon said, eyes on the ground, all signs of the anger he was ready to unleash moments ago completely evaporated.  \u201cEveryone got along.  Everyone was doing their part.  There was no crime, no fear, no homeless no hungry.  The streets were safe at all hours.  Children could walk alone at night through any street in the kingdom.  We all looked after each other.  And then\u2026\u201d\n\n\nI nodded.  \u201cAnd then. Lovejoy.\u201d\n\n\nElise was crying.  She looked down, not wanting to meet my eye.  She nodded.\n\n\n\u201cLovejoy.\u201d  The name rolled through my mouth, harsh and bitter.  I had refused to speak it for the entirety of my exile, keeping it out of my head and heart forever.\n\n\nI left them standing outside and turned back to the dimness of my house.  The inside of the cabin was dark and welcoming.  It smelt of dried wood and wildflowers.  It smelled like home.\n\n\nAs I looked around, I realised that my heart had already left.  I had been waiting here almost a decade preparing myself for this day and hoping it would never come.  I went to the chest at the foot of my bed, both of which I had fashioned by hand.  Inside the chest was a set of travel clothes that miraculously still fit, though the years of my time away from the academy meant they were tight around shoulders that had filled out with labour and loose around my waist where once I had carried more weight.  They were mage wear, though I had never been given my half-cloak nor had my skin be marked. I had been expelled well before I could earn them.\n\n\nMy travel pack, already prepared, was loaded with meat I had dried over spring and acorn meal bread.  My pantry was fully stocked.  I had little to do apart from stockpile and train, and that\u2019s all I had done for nine long years.\n\n\nLast of all came Regret.  It was a poor name for a sword, and not the one it was given on the day it was forged.  It was short, barely over a foot long.  The blade was as wide as my wrist and tapered to a wickedly sharp point.  There were no etching or markings on the blade, none that could be seen now.  If anything, it was boring.  I strapped it\u2019s sheathe to my right thigh, and hefted my pack.\n\n\nI left through the front door.  I didn\u2019t look back.\n\n\nElise and Dixon were back at the boundary of the clearing when I exited the house.  As I drew closer to them, I had to clutch at my power with everything I had to make sure it didn\u2019t take them.  They watched me approach with apprehension.  I paused in front of them, staring at Dixon.\n\n\n\u201cI told you,\u201d I growled, unable to keep my fury from my voice.  The strain of holding back didn\u2019t help.  \u201cI told you.  And you all refused to listen.  You railed, and you raged and you hated.  And instead of listening, you sent me away.\u201d\n\n\nI broke into a sweat.  I had grown in strength over the years.  Lacking the need to hold back, my strength had never been constrained like others.  I could feel the magic slipping slowly from my grasp and struggled to pull it back.\n\n\n\u201cI told you,\u201d I snapped one last time, stepping wide around them and onto the road.\n\n\n\u201cDo you want a horse?\u201d Dixon asked as I passed.\n\n\u201cFuck you, Dick-skin, you know better than that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s too strong now,\u201d Elise spoke low to her partner.  \u201cHe\u2019d claim anything that touched him.\u201d\n\n\nI swung wide of the soldiers, still sitting on skittish horses.  \u201cThere\u2019s food enough in that cabin for four weeks,\u201d I said as I headed out.\n\n\nOne of them spat in my direction.  I ignored them and headed North.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nI stood outside the city gates.  They were wide open.  Why wouldn\u2019t they be?\n\n\nIt had taken me three weeks of hard, continual walking to get here.  I avoided people, stealing food when needed and sleeping in barns or woods far from people.  It wasn\u2019t safe to be around me at night.\n\n\nThere was some kind of celebration going on.  There were voices of joy calling out, even at this time in the morning, and the sounds of loud music drifted along the streets.  People were starting to rouse, calling to each other from happily from windows and doors.  Everyone was already industriously getting to work, hanging bunting and cooking festive foods.  My mouth watered as the scent of baking bread and roasting sweet-meats filled my nostrils.\n\n\nI loosened Regret in her scabbard and wrapped my power around myself, pulling it as tightly as I could into myself, making sure it wouldn\u2019t affect those around me.  The castle was my destination.\n\n\nThe hair stood on the back of my neck after fifty metres.\n\n\nAt first it was hard to tell what was chafing my nerves.  Everyone I passed called out happy greetings.  They were eating, feeding children or the elderly, laughing and chatting.  They broke into song spontaneously and lavished attention on each other.  Couples, young and old alike showed each other genuine affection openly on the street.\n\n\nIt was too perfect.\n\n\nEverywhere the populace were showering each other other with praise.  Everyone was happy.  Everyone joyful.  Everyone working cheerfully and helping each other.  I was walking through an idyllic utopian wonderland where everyone cared for everyone else with a pristine perfect love.\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not how humanity works.  There was no dischord, no voices raised in anger, no shouts of alarm or cries of hurt.  There were no beggars crying for attention, no urchins running dirty through the streets with guardsmen tight on their tails.  There was no counterpoint to all the unbridled happiness and joy.\n\n\nThere were small signs that things weren\u2019t totally perfect, though you had to know what you were looking for.  A bakery that had traditionally belonged to a family for generations a different family, the shopfront facade brand new and freshly painted.  A guard-house converted clumsily into a book-binders.  An entire guild-house gone, replaced by a picture-perfect garden that stuck out like a missing tooth.  And then there was the Mages Quarter.\n\n\nMy feet had lead me there, though it was a deviation from the quickest route to the palace.  I had grown up in the Mages Quarter when I had shown signs of talent, before it was known what my skills would be.  Here, at the hub of the kingdom, where scores of the most knowledgeable and powerful people in the world had come to teach and learn.  To hone and sharpen their skills.  And to show off.\n\n\nI had learnt my letters and numbers from Julian Skyfire at the foot of a fire-fountain.  Logic and debate had been gently massaged into my mind by the Baroness Thinktwice herself.  I had watched buildings wished into being and then changed within the day by Earth Wizards and marvelled as Sea-Witches had manipulated magic-borne sea lanes overhead.  I studied negotiation from Empaths who could fill a person with confidence and rhetoric from the small cadre of Mood Mages, some of whom boosted morale, others who instilled fear.\n\n\nI stood at the edge of the new harbour-mouth, watching ships bobbing gently in the slow swell of the sheltered waters.  My feet had stopped right at the edge of what had once been Wizard\u2019s Way, the main thoroughfare through the Mages\u2019 Quarter, except instead of continuing down past the Academy and back around to the centre of the city, a wooden pier extended over the water in front of me.  \n\nTo each side and all along the harbour-front, buildings bore the fresh, clean look of recently repaired stonework but the angles were all wrong.  It took me a moment to realise that each of the houses curved slightly into the next building as if the had all been sheared in an arc.  As I looked around there was no mistaking the perfect circle of the wide harbour-front, broken only by the harbour mouth, as is curved away in front of me.  \n\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a new harbour.  It was a crater.\n\n\nSomething had torn the entire Quarter from the city, taking everything with it.  This happy waterfront with all the usual seaside noises and accompanying gulls, with children laughing and playing and couples walking hand-in-hand in the rising sun, this was scar tissue, the barely healed remnants of one of the jewels of our society.  A precise but cataclysmic force had taken the Mages\u2019 Quarter and everyone within, whether they were magician, apprentice, shopkeeper or porter.  All of it was gone.  My youth.  Gone.  Covered with a bandage of happy people.\n\n\nFor now, at least.  Sweat beaded across my forehead as I strained to contain my my emotions and my power.  It roiled and rolled within my stomach as I realised the enormity of destruction that had been unleashed here, of friends that had walked here before they turned to enemies and banished me.  It ached.  I could feel it leaking through holes in my control, straining against me, begging to be released.\n\n\n\u201cExcuse me, sir?\u201d a voice called behind me. \u201cYou look lost.  May I help you?\u201d\n\n\nI turned, fists clenched as I fought to hold back.  Behind me, a polite distance away, a young girl of barely sixteen stood poised to help, her beau several steps behind her smiling pleasantly.  Waves of unfeigned concern and helpful patience shone through her face.  There was no pretension, just a need to care and it made her beautiful.\nThe magic filled me, rushing in my ears.  It coursed through my veins, surging, needing release.  I needed to move.  I needed to keep away from people.  I needed to see this through.\n\n\nI grunted a negative and grasped Regret hard, turning towards the palace.  I needed to move fast.  This diversion had cost me.  Soon the streets would fill, and then all hell would break loose.\n\n\nI dodged between the porters, labourers and others that filled the dockside, cursing my foolishness for choosing such a heavily trafficked area, even this early in the day.  I couldn\u2019t touch anyone, not even slightly, or with this amount of energy reigned in I would claim them without even knowing.  Children dodged past in front of me, laughing and playing, only just dancing out from in front of me.  I charged on.\n\n\nBy the time I hit the central boulevard, it was an hour past dawn and I realised how mistaken I had been.  Already, it was packed with people celebrating and cheering, singing and dancing.  Music was being played from every inn and custom-house and even more musicians stood at street corners, crying out in happiness.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I looked closely at the banners of celebration that I realised that each of them was very slightly worn. The holiday stores, too, showed signs of wear.  The festive clothes worn by each person I shied away from was slightly faded, as though they were still well-made, but had seen a lot of wear.  It took a moment for me to realise that this wasn\u2019t a one-off celebration or holy day.  This same event took place every day in Lovejoy\u2019s kingdom.  This outpouring of ecstasy wasn\u2019t an exception - it was the norm.\n\n\nThis close to the palace, the festivities were already well underway.  I spied couples canoodling openly and getting heated in shaded alleys or slightly darkened corners.  The wine was in full-flow, and although the celebrations were boisterous, each patron took care of others around them.  No fights were breaking out.  No guards were in sight to break-up public disturbances.  No sounds of alarm anywhere.  I pushed on.\n\n\nIt happened about one hundred feet from the palace doors.  The gilded archway was wide open, welcoming and inviting, and people streamed in and out freely.  I had slowed as I passed a large inn, contemplating how to get through the stream of humanity without touching a soul.  My thoughts were elsewhere.\n\n\u201cFriend!\u201d a voice shouted near my ear. I turned to find a burly man with a stonemasons shoulders holding a heavy mug out towards me.  \u201cYou need to try this!  It\u2019s some of the last mage-brewed ale left in the city!\u201d\n\n\nI had scowled at the frothing mug.  Who offers mage-kind a drink that strong?  Even without the cloak, I should have been recognisable.\n\n\nI hadn\u2019t noticed the man step closer, hand reaching out. \u201cYou can really taste the mag-\u201d\n\n\nHe fell to the ground, growling harshly, mug clattering and spilling across the floor.  Around him, his friends and compatriots laughed gently at his mistake and some bent down to help him to his feet.\n\n\nEven though I could feel the gentle warmth on my shoulder where he had touched me, it took me a second to realise what had happened.\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I whispered, but it was too late.\n\n\nWith a roar, the man surged to his feet, his fist taking one in the face with enough force to lift them off their feet, his other hand closing around the throat of another.  His face was a rictus of scorn, his movements precise and destructive.\n\n\nHe pulled the one he had grasped close to his face.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re nothing,\u201d he whispered tightening his grip and crushing the windpipe beneath.\n\n\nHe dropped his friend who gurgled and thrashed, straining for a breath that would never come, and looked out at the rest of the table who had yet to realise the dire situation they were in.\n\n\n\u201cAll of you,\u201d he spat, veins bulging out of a mask of rage, \u201cAll of you are worms.  You are takers.  I\u2019ve given everything for you.  And you take and take and take.\u201d\n\n\nHe reached for a cheeseboard, picking up the paring knife.  \u201cYou are worthless,\u201d he growled, lashing out and catching a man who had been checking on one of the fallen.  \u201cYou are dogs,\u201d he slashed again another person falling back with a cry.\n\n\nBehind him, I moved.  Regret flew into my hand, snaking through the air.  I sliced, Regret\u2019s point sighing between the fourth and fifth vertebrae without travelling deeper to contact the jugular arteries.  Death was instant.\n\n\nAs his body hit the floor, I was already moving towards the golden portal of the palace.  When the screams started, I broke into a run, flicking the sliver of blood from my blade.  When the doors started to edge closed, I let go, releasing the pent up power that had been raging through my core since I had come out of exile.\n\n\nHate.  It slammed through the crowds in a visible wave, rocking most on their feet and dropping others completely.  There was a pause whilst the force of my power took control of their peaceful thoughts and moods and turned them to hateful scorn.  Whomever had been closing the doors of the palace had stopped, likely as the strength of my Hate poured over them.  All around me, ordinary citizens of a loving, caring community turned into a horde of hate-filled rage beasts.\n\n\nThe shouts came first.  The the growls of rage.  Then the screams of pain and anger.\n\n\nWhere once people had danced and sung, people now moved to riot.  Fraternal love turned to screaming battle, joy to death.  \n\n\nUsing whatever they had at hand - paving stones, chair legs, branches, bottles, mugs - every man woman and child tore at each other in a seething mass.  Men grappled with their wives, children with their siblings, lovers - so recently in embraces of love - now struggled to take each other\u2019s lives.  Strangely, a large music box still rang out over the cacophony. rattling out it\u2019s peppy, up-beat tune in counter-point to the destruction around it.\n\n\nI raced for the door.  A boy of ten or less leapt at me, hands clawed, outstretched.  I swayed to the side, Regret\u2019s hilt finding his temple and sending him sprawling, senseless.  With the screams of the dead and dying behind me, I entered the palace.\n\n\nInside, Hate was taking over.  The grand entrance was a lofty atrium.  Usually it was a bright place, bursting with light.  When I had lived here in the capital, the Queens\u2019 personal cadre of mages had ensured that a new wonder graced this space every month.  Once it had been a tree, grown overnight, that had stairs sprouting from it\u2019s sides to create easier access to the floors above.  Another time, the floor had been made transparent, and below was a full-scale map of the known world.\n\n\nNow, it was still bright and airy, but instead of marvels it was full of small melees and littered with the broken and dying.  Guilt swamped me as I saw the devastation my unchecked power was having, but I knew that this close to the centre of power, Lovejoy would already have claimed them.  They would be bare shells of themselves, given completely to Lovejoy and her whims.\n\n\nThrough the atrium I ran, Regret lashing out when people got too close, mouths full of scorn and eyes brimming with hate.  Into the waiting rooms beyond.  There, the last of the mage-born waged war upon each other.  Darkness flooded the entire hall as flares of light and lightning arced through the air.  The ground thundered and rippled at my feet.  Lovejoy must have cloistered them here, a last line of defence against any foe, even though any in the city would be touched by her, and any this close to her would be her creatures completely.\n\n\nExcept for one.  Except for me.\n\n\nI paused, as a misstep here could end me.  A Wind Wizard could steal my breath without me laying eyes on them, a falling rock could crush me as easily as any other.  Focussing, I pushed out, channelling my power outward, focussing the Hate of those in front me.  Instead of letting it ravage unchecked, I turned it inwards.  Screeches of anger turned to moans of self-loathing as my former brethren gave in to despair.  \n\n\nThe light returned to a room torn asunder.  Shattered fragments of masonry had toppled, broken and scorched, upon other members of the arcanum.  What had once been thunderous noise now stood still bar the moans of people who hated themselves too much to stay alive.\n\n\nI clambered over the destruction that had been wrought only moments before.  To each side of me, witches and wizards lay dead or dying.  A scorched corpse.  A body drained of blood.  I tried to block it out, but still I cried.  I hated them.  I hated them as they had hated me, as they had banished me for defying their master plan.  But at one time they had been friends.\n\n\nAt the last gateway, I found Julian Skyfire curled up and weeping.  I was still exerting my will, but through the self-loathing, she looked up.\n\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d she croaked through tears.\n\n\nI stopped and watched my tutor crumble.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d I said at last.\n\n\n\u201cI was right about you,\u201d she said.  \u201cBut I was wrong about you being right.  You were right.  About so much\u2026\u201d\n\n\nI sighed.  I had no tears left in me for these people.  \u201cI was only really right about Lovejoy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough.  Who would have thought that it would go wrong?\u201d Julian cried.\n\n\nI loosened my power gently from her.  Maybe Lovejoy hadn\u2019t taken her completely.  Maybe she was still in there somewhere.  If I didn\u2019t do the same level of damage, maybe she could be saved.\n\n\nI leaned in.  \u201cI did.  I thought it could go wrong,\u201d I growled, low and hard.  I went to leave.\n\n\n\u201cDin!\u201d Skyfire called.\n\n\nI turned back.\n\n\n\u201cDid you see the harbour?\u201d\n\n\nI didn\u2019t answer.  She held her hand over her chest, a bright glow shining from her palm.\n\n\n\u201cI did it,\u201d she gasped, fresh sobs ripping from her folded form.  I squinted as the light in her hand grew brighter against her chest.  \u201cI loved her so much.  I just wanted to make her happy!  I would do anything\u2026 anything\u2026\u201d\n\n\nWith a final blaze, Skyfire disappeared with a sharp crack.  A low, perfect bowl was left smoking in the marble where she had crouched.\n\n\nI pressed on.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nLovejoy was in the throneroom.\n\n\nI hadn\u2019t met any resistance the entire journey past the last of the magi.  I had felt them as they snuffed themselves from existence.  Without anyone to fight, I had struggled to pull my unleashed power of hate back under control before the entire city was reduced to rubble.  There had to be something left after all this.\n\n\nI had made a quick search of the Queen\u2019s quarters, but had found them empty and unused for what must have been several years.  But I always knew she would be here.\n\n\nThe room was empty except for her.  She sat at the foot of the stairs leading to the throne.  She was wearing simple clothes, but exceptionally tailored.  I could see she still fancied herself some kind of simple retainer rather than a dictator who had suppressed the will of a nation.\n\n\nShe looked up as I drew closer.\n\n\n\u201cDin,\u201d she smiled.  Her voice hadn\u2019t changed.  The rest of her was almost the same.  There were laugh lines around her eyes and more weight in her face, but she looked carefree.  \u201cI knew you\u2019d come.\u201d\n\n\nI had nothing to say.  She was both the same person I knew years ago and at the same time a monster complete.  It was a struggle to reconcile one against the other.\n\n\n\u201cA world of Love, Din.  Just like I envisioned.  Everyone caring for everyone else.  Nobody left alone.  It was perfect,\u201d she smiled and laughed to herself.  I said nothing.\n\n\n\u201cAnd then some dissented.  Not many at first.  They came to me in secret.  Said that we had taken free will from the people, that man wasn\u2019t meant to love everyone and everything at all times.  That we no longer allowed people the choice of being themselves.  Asked me to intervene with the Queen, to allow people to make their own choices, even bad ones.  Choices unguided by love, blinded by hate.\u201d\n\n\nShe put her head in her hands.\n\n\n\u201cBut\u2026 what if someone makes a really bad choice?  What if someone kills in anger or hate?  What then?\u201d she sighed.  \u201cSo I reached out and took them.  Anyone who came against the Queen and I.  And then the Queen herself had second thoughts.  They Loved me, and they would do anything to please me.  They'd care for their friends.  Give to the poor.  Feed the needy.  Or stop those who opposed me.  Like Skyfire\u2026 poor Skyfire.\u201d\n\n\nShe looked at me.\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t meant to be like this, Din,\u201d she cried, softly.\n\n\nI hefted Regret.  And looked at her.  The tilt of her chin, the lines of her mouth.  All of her.  I had known her so closely for so long, and even now my arms ached to be with her.\n\n\nI swallowed back my own emotions as I stepped forwards.  \u201cI loved you, Dana.  Before all of this.\u201d\n\n\nShe smiled.  \u201cI know,\u201d she said.  \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t even have to make you Love me.  Isn\u2019t that marvellous?\u201d\n\n\nRegret fell.\n",

The display within my helmet came to life with a heads up display of where everything was located. The army certainly had some wonderful tools at their disposal.\n \nKnowing that Zanders would be waiting on a column of black smoke to arise from the far side of the base made things difficult. I couldn\u2019t simply try to leave without being chased down or putting Pross in danger; not to mention, Zanders knew my face now. I looked back to Pross\u2019 inert body slumped over the back seat and thought hard about what I had to work with.\n \nThere was an unresolved issue that came to mind, one that could help us out of this situation. I was more than hesitant to put such a plan in action, but being low on options, I got the Humvee moving and drove towards the warehouse that Pross and I had emerged from.\n \nUpon stopping the vehicle, I had decided to reposition Pross, so he could at least be comfortable. He was still unconscious and disheveled, blood stained his clothing and a low, persistent wheeze followed his every exhalation. This would be a good moment for a dose patch. Such amenities were not currently available to me however. I'd give him one of the pills Jules had packed, but with him unconscious he could just choke to death on one of them. I decided to it best to move through my next task quickly.\n \nI entered the warehouse and strolled towards the barrel that Pross and I had stashed the real Iwatsu in. The barrels we had stacked were knocked over. The lid of one of the containers was left lying next to the barrel. The guy must\u2019ve got out. Hopefully he didn\u2019t get far. I switched over to thermal imaging on my helmet and began scanning the room. \n \nSuddenly, I was blindsided and thrown to the ground by a vicious shoulder tackle. A whirl of colors erupted before my vision as heat signatures around me spiked. An orange shadow started swinging its blazing red fists into my armor. A voice yelled \u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d\n \nMy hands, still held tight to the rifle, lifted to defend myself. I tried to present the broad side of the rifle as somewhat of a shield to little avail. He furiously pounded away at my face and upper body. He rose up to bring his fist back down on my face as I let out two shots into his chest. He reeled back and I could see through the thermal imaging the warm blood exiting his body and spilling out. Still holding his wounds, he fell to his knees momentarily before his body contorted and he lay in an orange ball on the floor.\n \nI switched the helmet back to a normal view. A soldier lay at my feet dead and I was covered in his blood. The blood seeped out and pooled around the lifeless body. My hands clawed at my helmet as I pried it off. I felt nauseous and hot and short of breath. Even knowing that this man would have to die, I didn\u2019t see it happening this way. Simply tossing him into an incinerator would\u2019ve probably had the same results I\u2019m experiencing now. I\u2019ve got to act quickly before someone investigates the sound of those shots though. I don\u2019t have time to fall apart.\n \nStatic crackled on the helmet and a voice sprang up. I hastily threw the helmet back on and attempted to answer the call.\n \n\u201cWatson! Report in!\u201d\n \n\u201cI\u2019m here Zanders, I\u2019m here.\u201d\n \n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the gunshots? My rig is telling me you\u2019re in a storage facility. What the hell are you doing?\u201d\n \n\u201cHe almost got away. Guy woke up, but two shots to the chest put him back to sleep. Heading to the incinerator now.\u201d\n \n\u201cDamn Watson, I knew you had it in you. Now go heat up that ice cold heart by the fire.\u201d\n \n\u201cRoger.\u201d I clicked the comm off and let out a deep sigh. I stooped low and struggled to lift the now deceased Iwatsu. He\u2019s either heavier than he looks or I\u2019m not as strong as I\u2019d like to believe. I gradually got him into the Humvee next to Pross, who was still unconscious and barely breathing. I wondered what he would\u2019ve thought about what I had just done.\n \nI drove off towards the incinerator, the still of the night added an eerie quiet that fell all around like a shroud. The only sound that could be heard was the grinding of rubber on asphalt as I rolled over the ground. The moon was high in the sky and looming over a blanket of stars as I could hear Pross coughing and start moving about in the back.\n \nI adjusted the rear view mirror to get a look at Pross and saw that he was kicking Iwatsu\u2019s body away from him. \u201cThank God you\u2019re alright\u201d I said as I saw him moving. \u201cI could really use your help Pross.\u201d\n \nHe said nothing in response. I could barely see his face in the mirror, so I stopped the car to take a look at him. He wasn\u2019t kicking the body intentionally. He was thrashing about uncontrollably it seemed. I quickly got out of the drivers seat and ran around to the back seat. Opening the door, I immediately grabbed Pross from under his arms and pulled him onto the ground. \u201cShit, stay with me Pross.\u201d\n \nI searched my pockets for the pill Jules had given me and tried to get Pross to swallow it.\n\u201cCome on, just take this, everything is going to be fine, you\u2019re going to be okay, just swallow this down.\u201d I pushed the pill past his lips and he gulped it down.\n \nHe strained through gasping breaths to take in more air. His convulsing was slowing, but he still kicked a bit randomly. I started to calm down a bit myself and stayed seated on the ground next to him. His slight wheezing was the only thing keeping me company. That is, until he let out a low, long, wheezing sigh and stopped breathing.\n \n\u201cPross?\u201d I shook him a little with one hand. \u201cPross?\u201d I shook him harder. \u201cShit man, wake up.\u201d I tried giving him CPR and started chest compressions like I\u2019d seen on so many television shows, but still couldn\u2019t hear him breathing. I grew frantic after a few moments as I slowly realized that nothing I was doing was working. At one point I think I was just pounding on his chest as I felt tears streaming down my face.\n \nThe pill must have been too little too late. He wasn\u2019t breathing. I couldn\u2019t find a pulse. I couldn\u2019t bring him back. I was lost and trapped and so far from where it was I wanted to be. I can\u2019t stay here. I\u2019ve got to keep moving.\n \nI picked up Pross\u2019 body and guided it into the open back seat. He slumped downwards with his head pushing against the floor of the Humvee. I carefully repositioned him into a seated position and secured a seatbelt over him so he wouldn\u2019t move. I closed the back door and got in to the driver\u2019s seat once more.\n \nI pointed the car towards the location of the incinerator as indicated by the display in my helmet. The tires ground to a halt as I reached my destination. I walked to the large, chimney-like structure and opened the hatch. The orange glow of fiery embers danced about the darkness and brought forth warmth. Light sounds of crackling and hissing came out of the depths of the incinerator. I left the hatch open and went to retrieve the bodies from the vehicle.\n \nI pulled Iwatsu out first, his big frame being the heavier of the two. I hoisted him up into a fireman\u2019s carry and crab walking sideways was able to slide him into the incinerator. The orange glow ceased its dance momentarily, only to let out a belch of acrid black smoke a moment later.\n \nI went back to the vehicle and stood before Pross\u2019 body. Knowing he too would be engulfed in flames, I felt a deep pang of guilt. He had done all he could to help me. All I could give in return was an inadequate resting place. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m truly, truly sorry Pross. You deserve much better than this.\u201d\n \nI lifted his body in the same fashion as I did Iwatsu\u2019s. My unsteady legs brought him closer to the warmth of the flames. I set him down on the lip of the opening; his body languidly started to slip away into the belly of the fire. As he tumbled backwards into the fire, the crackling sound grew louder and the dense smoke grew darker. I buckled the hatch back down and went back to the Humvee.\n \nAnother call sounded through a crackle of static in my helmet. Zanders\u2019 voice rose up in my ear. \u201cGood shit Watson.  Looks like you\u2019re my new wingman.\u201d\n",

Hope you don't mind me posting here since r/WritingPrompts helped get me started.\n\nI wrote a crime thriller based in a small town in central Texas titled \"Nothing Too Original\". It's a quick read and based on real events though it is a fictionalized account.\n\nYou can check it out here on [Amazon!](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N0GD2KQ)\n\nIf anyone wants to actually buy a copy, that's cool but I'm more than willing to send a PDF to anyone that wants one. Just PM me. I'll be doing physical copies through CreateSpace in the next week or so.\n\nReddit has been amazing in helping my development as a fiction writer. r/WritingPrompts and other sub-reddits are full of talented people willing to offer guidance and support. \n\nTo help others writing crime or mystery stories, I've launched r/CrimesInProgress where you can share stories, bounce around ideas, or whatever else you need.\n\nThanks again to everyone and keep writing!",

Since I had sold my cellphone last week to help pay off some of my debts, I was without a way to call for anyone from anywhere, and would have to rely on other people and public phones to make calls. As I waited for the taxi to arrive, I pulled the airline ticket out of the bag and took note of the flight schedule.\n\n\u201cRichmond International Airport, Flight DL142 from Richmond to Wichita.\u201d I smiled as I read the next line. \u201cSeat 4A.\u201d First class. A nice touch, since the flight would be about 6 hours long. I couldn\u2019t think of the last time I had ridden first class\u2026\n\nI took out one stack of hundreds and flipped it against my thumb, a gentle breeze meeting my face as the bills moved. I hadn\u2019t seen this much money in one place in a long time. I looked up, as if it would help me remember the last time I held this much money. \n\nIt must have been four years ago. It was hard to picture the money in my hands because it didn\u2019t mean anything compared to the prolonged hug I shared with Ana at the end of that day. \n\n\u201cWho would have guessed you and that crazy guy were right?\u201d She told me before wrapping her arms around me and looking me in the eyes. I leaned in and we shared a kiss that seemed eternal and fleeting at the same time, an indescribable emotion that I never quite forgot. We pulled away from each other in sync, and she beamed. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love so much about you, Richard: you always-\u201c\n\nAngry honking and a flurry of swears, combined with the stench of a poorly maintained exhaust brought me back to the real world.\n\n\u201cHey jackass, I haven\u2019t got all day!\u201d The taxi driver shouted, waving a fat cigarillo to the backseat of his cab. \n\n\u201cOh, right, sorry.\u201d I scrambled to my feet and threw open the door. I crawled in the back as fast as I could and shut the door. \u201cJust take me to a decent hotel that\u2019s close to the Richmond International Airport.\u201d\n\n\u201cBest Western fine by you?\u201d The cab driver was already speeding away at a breakneck pace, barely giving me the chance to buckle up. \n\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s fine.\u201d I said, fearing for my safety, clutching the envelope that determined my future tightly to my chest. \n\nThe ride to the hotel was quick, and I paid the driver, getting out as quickly as I could. I was especially happy to be rid of the smell of that man\u2019s awful Tropical Fusion Swisher Sweet. Walking inside, I immediately flashed my cash to the receptionist in fear that I would be kicked out due to my smell, and was given the key to a second floor bedroom after paying. I thanked the receptionist and practically ran up to my room. Unlocking the door in an instant, I rushed inside, threw off my clothes, being careful with my precious tie, and jumped in the shower.\n\nFew things are as liberating as the feeling of warm water on greasy skin and dirty hair. As I washed every ounce of filth I could see and feel from my body, I found myself in a state of euphoria unlike any other. \n\n\u201cYou always take the coldest showers!\u201d I could hear Ana playfully say as she splashed me with the boiling water she demanded she be cleansed in. I respond to her, telling her that she simply has no sense of temperature and that she must be crazy to bathe in water that would surely be used to boil oysters. \u201cI NEVER have the water that hot!\u201d She says with a wry grin on her face, tossing a flirty wink my way as she turns around, exposing her wet back to me. \u201cNow, would you kindly get the spots I missed?\u201d \n\nI reach for her perfect body, but instead find myself grabbing the handle of the shower. With a grim sigh, I turn it to the left and the stream of water stops. For a few moments, I rest my head against the wall, right beneath the shower head, and do everything in my power to hold back the urge to cry hard. Some incredibly shaky breaths and gently wiped eyes later, I slowly push myself off the wall of the shower and step out, grabbing a towel and drying off as I do. \n\nSitting at the end of my bed with my pants on and my shirt unbuttoned, I trace my hands along the back of my tie where Ana\u2019s loving message seems to bring me warmth and chill my bones simultaneously. \n\n\u201cAna\u2026\u201d I whisper to myself, so quietly that I only know what I\u2019m saying because of the way I feel. \u201cI swear to you, Ana, and I swear to all of Creation-\u201c \n\nWhether I wanted it to or not, it had started. I could feel the tears fall down my face and into my lap as I began to sob miserably, choking out my promise to no one in particular.\n\n\u201c-I suh-swear to Gah-Gah-God, he-his only Son, the Ho-Ho-Holy Spirit, and his fallen angel that-\u201c I sniff hard, trying my best to be clear. \n\n\u201c-No matter what happens tomorrow, win or lose, live or die, that if I win-\u201c\n\nI stand up, breathing in strongly as I prepare to say the end of my promise.\n\n\u201c-I will never gamble again. I won\u2019t do anything that would harm our relationship as badly as my poor behavior has, and I will do everything in my power to treat you the way you\u2019ve always treated me, Ana. I-\u201c\n\nA feeling of strength came to me, akin to the feelings I\u2019ve had when facing very bad odds while knowing in my gut that I was going to win. As I thought of my dear Ana, I felt a bittersweet smile chisel its way into my features.\n\n\u201cI love you so much, Ana.\u201d\n\nWith that, I grabbed a few tissues from the box on the nightstand and cleaned myself up, stuffing a few into my pocket in case I were to have another episode later. As I button up my shirt and tighten my tie around my neck, I check the digital clock that rests next to the tissue box.\n\n11:53 A.M.\n\nDespite the lengthy time that I was blessed with, the day passed by fast. I mainly used the time to run a few errands, but I also took advantage of the local dining options and gorged myself on large plates of greasy food. I also purchased a second set of clothes, some stationary, and had my current outfit dry cleaned so I could wear it to the game. I ended my day around 8 P.M., and stared at the ceiling until I fell asleep. Before I gave into the rapture of Dreamland, I closed my eyes and repeated the words I had said so many times before. This time, however, I felt as if I truly understood their meaning.\n\n\"I love you so much, Ana.\"\n\nTomorrow, I could live or die. But it's not the thought of death that terrifies me. It's the possibility of never being with my dear Ana ever again that fuels any potential nightmares. And I know, no matter what, I'm going to do whatever it takes to make myself worthy of looking my dear Ana in the eyes again.\n\n---\n\nAs always, check back later for [Part 5](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5emwn9/pi_there_is_a_strange_lottery_that_picks_a_random/).
