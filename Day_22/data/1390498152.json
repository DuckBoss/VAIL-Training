            "selftext": "The beeps grew faint. Though his body was frail, his mind was still sharp. He knew he was dying. Robert didn't mind dying. He was tired - his last few weeks of struggle brought him the needed acceptance of passing on.\n\n\n\"I can't,\" his daughter said, choking back tears when he asked her for the favor.\n\n\n\"I know you wouldn't decide this on your own,\" he said, enjoying the grip of her hand on his. \"So I'm deciding for you. Let me rest.\" Ever the leader, even in the face of death. He knew his daughter and loved her. She reminded him so much of his late wife, both in looks and in loyalty to him.\n\n\nShe made the arrangements and a week later here he was, with his daughter and grandchild, son-in-law and his family, the machines turned off and the beep of one monitoring his heart gradually slowing. For a brief moment, there was a hint of fear - no, panic when his vision started to dim. But he was too well disciplined to let his emotions get the best of him. Robert took pride in how he was always in command of nearly every aspect of his life. His father told him early on people would spend their life wasting time trying to find meaning in life. \"Son, all life is is finding a pretty lady, making her happy, and making sure your children grow up right.\"\n\n\nSo that's what he did, and he made it his first and foremost duty was to make her feel loved. She loved him truly and birthed their beautiful daughter. She supported him in his career, going as planned, and he loved every day of it. He had a drive that inspired those around him and the kind of confidence that was noticeable but not egotistic. He was ready to move on. The panic would not best him. Wihy should he fear? Minerals nourish plants. Plants feed animals, which in turn feed humans. He would simply become part of the next greater, grander phase of the cycle - whatever it may be. \n\n\nA sinking feeling brought him back to the present. All of a sudden, he was more tired than ever before. He couldn't see though he didn't remember closing his eyes. The darkness started swallowing him. First at the soles of his feet and his fingertips, it crawled over him but the feeling was also instant. When he couldn't feel his chest anymore his hearing went as well, the sound of his daughter's sobs fading away. Then there was nothing.\n\n\nSuch emptiness was so foreign. The world he knew had been so full. Full of water and land, wind and fire, wonders of nature, so many people, their kindness and cruelty, their violence and their love - it was a world of *life.* And now he had experienced death. It was not as terrifying as he had anticipated, no in fact it was almost a dull event like a breeze blowing out a candle. He thought it was disappointing. He felt depressed. Now, in this place of nothingness, he felt lonely. He felt-\n\n\n*Wait,* he thought. He *felt.* He *thought.*\n\n\n*I'm dead... am I supposed to be able to* feel *and* think*?* This realization of consciousness startled him. The stab of panic again tried to take over but he willed it away. His first instinct was to look, but there was nothing to look at. He only wanted to see something - anything that would help him make sense of what was happening, but what happened next defied all that made sense to him.\n\n\nHe turned around and saw a man standing in front of him. They stood opposite each other in the darkness, the void, but the man in front of him glowed. The man was tall and slightly heavy-set and had a handsome, bearded face with a prominent nose. He had not seen a face so clearly in such a long time - not without his glasses. Robert raised his hands in front of his face and saw the strong, young, full hands of his youth. His eyes trailed to his arms, surprised at the lack of veins he had gotten used to seeing. He hugged himself and felt the fullness of his body - the hefty bulk of himself pleasing. He looked again at the glowing man and saw that he was also hugging himself. He smiled and realized the glowing man was his reflection. \n\n\nThe smile turned into a wide grin and he let out a loud hoot of pleasure. He clapped his hands over his mouth, startled by the loud bellow of his voice. His hands explored his face, tracing the outlines of his features, combing his thick beard, and no matter how much he poked and rubbed the smile would not leave his face. His perfect, white teeth gleamed back at him. He took a step closer (seemingly walking on nothing) and stretched out his hand carefully toward the reflection, wanting to touch something. The two opposing fingertips closed the space between them and when they touched ripples emanated from them distorted the reflection. The small waves of light continued infinitely across the expanse of nothing.\n\n\nRobert pushed further and his hand went deeper in, the ripples of light increased and intensified. He pushed his other hand through and took another step forward and another, his reflection now nothing but a vibrating wall of light. As he was about to take his final step he closed his eyes and took a deep breath before plunging through. He kept his eyes shut, not knowing what to expect, anxiety corroding his will to continue. None of this seemed real to him. How could it be real? After collecting his thoughts he opened his eyes to see stars. Billions and billions of them studded in the deep blues and purples of space, and ahead of him, another glowing man floated with his legs crossed, gazing at him.\n\n\nHe floated closer, by merely thinking of moving he did so, until they were at arms' length. The man looked strange to him, certainly not like any man he had ever seen. He was completely hairless and looked to be made of gold, clad in robes of turquoise with sleeves that floated loosely over him.\n\n\nThe man uncrossed his legs and gave Robert a tight embrace then held him by the shoulders \"Welcome, brother.\" His mouth did not move but the voice that came from him was raspy and he sounded as if his tongue was curled on top of itself though his diction was clear and perfect.\n\n\n\"I'm dead.\" Robert blurted, not being able to stop it. His mind was running on overdrive, and he spoke not with his mouth but with a kind of projection of thought.\n\n\n\"Hm, it is true that you have died,\" the strange looking man said, \"but you are not dead. If you were, you would not be here with me right now. My name is At'wien.\"\n\n\n\"At'wien,\" again Robert's thoughts seemed to float out of him. \"Are you God?\"\n\n\n\"You might say so. That is what your people have come to think of me, though in different names in different places.\" He placed a golden arm around Robert's shoulders so they stood side to side. \"I have watched over you, many of you, for a *very* long time now.\"\n\n\nRobert constructed his next thought carefully, surprised at how quickly he was learning this new form of communication. \"Is this what happens to everyone when they die?\"\n\n\n\"Oh, no. You are one of the special few that have achieved *Praylia*, only a handful from Earth have done so.\"\n\n\n\"Praylia?\"\n\n\n\"Transcendence; this is as close as your language comes to it.\"\n\n\n\"And what do you mean by only a handful *from Earth*?\"\n\n\nAt'wien let out a small chuckle. \"Hm, I must say it is always pleasing to speak to a young god from Earth. You always are such an inquisitive kind.\"\n\n\nThese answers seemed to open more channels for Robert to question, proving the statement. \"I'm a god?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, that is what happens when you achieve Praylia. The purity of your soul, the good of your heart, the devotion of your mind - all your deeds led you here.\"\n\n\n\"I did not intend to achieve Praylia.\"\n\n\n\"Nor did you intend to be born. These are things that happen. Your death was just another version of birth - here and now. You have become a god and when you are ready, I will take you to the others,\" he gestured with an open hand to the stars they gazed at.\n\n\n\"Who are the others?\" Robert turned to look at the perfectly chiseled face of the golden man.\n\n\n\"Gods from other places, other beings that have achieved Praylia. As I said, some of them were humans from Earth as you were, and you will meet them too in time.\" \n\n\n\"Where are you from?\"\n\n\n\"A different place, and a different time. Much like you are here and we are now, I was once born into Praylia and another received me and guided me like I unto you. That was a time long past and it is difficult to explain this in your language.\"\n\n\nRobert smiled. \"So what does this all mean? Why create us? What's the point of it all.\"\n\n\nThe raspy laugh resonated through the cosmos. \"Your birth here and now is a result of the world I have created, much as my birth was the result of a world created by another. Come with me and I will show you. You must see it for words take away the significance of it all.\"\n\n\nRobert thought of his life past. In an instant he saw everything, and felt all that was to be felt, and saw that the next step was to move forward. He saw his daughter, weeping over his old, lifeless, former shell. He saw her husband, a fine young man, grieving with her. He saw a family that shed tears over his death, though they knew him little and owed him nothing. He saw his wife again and loved her again, not that he ever stopped loving her, but in his mind now he was able to fully experience and appreciate the time he spent with her. Praylia began to make sense to him. He held At'wien by the hand and gave him a small nod and an honest smile. \n\n\nOn the night of Robert's death, the night was calm and the breeze was cool. The sky was beautiful and the moon shone brightly down on the land. A shooting star shot over the city and nobody saw it but it was there.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: typos",

            "selftext": "/r/WritingPrompts, the esteemed Internet community, will be distributing its **first quarterly e-zine within the next few months**. The e-zine will represent the content of writing prompts in the most comprehensive way possible. It will feature prompts, writing advice, the delicious humour of the mod squad, and - of course - user-submitted prompt responses. That is where you all come in.\n\n/r/WritingPrompts produces thousands of words each month, and even with a dedicated mod team like the one we have, it would be impossible to get through all the prompt responses and represent the quality of our community. Seeing as all of our content is generated by that community, we turn to you to give us your idea of what the best of this subreddit is. Introducing the first **Quarterly Nomination Thread!**\n\nIn this thread, please post the **best prompt responses from your experiences here - from any time in the subreddit's history**. From all the nominated pieces, the editors will review and select the highest quality submissions to include in the first or future issues.\n\n--\n\n**NOMINATION GUIDELINES:**\n\nNominations should be formatted in this way: \n\n&gt; /u/writersusername - [response](permalink to comment) to the prompt [[TAG] title of prompt](shortlink to prompt). [Genre.] One sentence about why you chose the story. \n\nAn example of this is:\n\n&gt; /u/fetfet50 - [response](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1lgp8u/ff_so_come_here_often/cbz5mpn) to the prompt [[FF] \"So, come here often?\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1lgp8u/ff_so_come_here_often) [Historical/Drama.] I really appreciated how such a simple story could bring forth so much emotion.\n\nPlease try to **select a genre** from the list below:\n\n* Science Fiction\n* Fantasy\n* Historical\n* Drama\n* Comedy\n* Mystery\n* Horror\n* Romance\n\nNominations not submitted in this format ***will be removed*** from the nomination thread.\n\nYou may nominate more than one prompt response \u2013 **any user can nominate up to five (5) prompt responses**. There is a limit of one nomination for prompt response, however \u2013 **do not put multiple prompt responses in a single comment** or they will be removed.\n\n**You may nominate yourself once.**\n\nFeel free to show your support for a user submission with an upvote or comment in support, but keep in mind that **we will not base selections on comment score**, nor are we looking for debates on the merits of individual pieces.\n\n**Submissions end February 28th.**\n\n--\n\nWith all that in mind, please, show us what you love to see in our community! Enjoy!\n\nSincerely, [/u/fetfet50](http://i.imgur.com/7plqT9O.jpg) and [the /r/WritingPrompts moderator team](http://i.imgur.com/t34HW2X.jpg)",

            "selftext": "**Hello again from the moderators of WritingPrompts!**\n\nCritiques threads are bi-weekly and normally fall on Saturdays. This time I delayed the post a day to give [the contest](http://redd.it/1xy5o7) hosted by /u/withviolence a chance to finish up.\n\nFor those new to the subreddit: Post something you have written in response to a prompt in the subreddit. Either myself, one of the other mods or another reader will give you a critique, however small.\n\n* **CRITIQUERS:** A critique should be a double pronged tool: Tell the writer what you liked (this is important!) and tell them what they could improve upon.\n\n* **STORYTELLERS:** This gives your story more readers, but also opens you up to criticism, so be sure you can take it. Also, please correct all grammar/spelling/little nits beforehand. Expect to be mercilessly teased for all typos you miss, because that is fun. If you have done that important step the focus will be on the content itself. Though, if you don't do that, it is sometimes good to hear how to improve your grammar anyway. If you are searching for something specific in a critique, write what that is (example: \"Is the character of Jack believable? Did you understand what I was describing in the second paragraph?\") and then separate those out of story questions with a linebreak (on Reddit that would be a row of six dashes ------ on its own separated by a blank line.)\n\n**Also, please link to the prompt your response came from. It helps to know the context.**\n\nAs always, have fun!\n\n-----\n\n**COME CHAT WITH US**\n\nIt's a great place to hang out or get writing help (as long as people are around. Usually evenings in North America are the times most people are active. If nobody is around, chat with yourself for an hour.)\n\nHere are the various ways to access the chatroom on many different devices (credit to /u/SolarAquarion on the HexChat and HoloIRC suggestions):\n\n- Through your web browser (with flash): [Just click here](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.snoonet.org/writingprompts)\n- iPad/iPhone/etc: An app called [Rooms](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rooms-your-iphone-irc-chat/id288282245?mt=8) is your best bet.\n- Android tablets and phones: [AndroIRC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androirc&amp;hl=en), [HoloIRC](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fusionx.lightirc) and [AndChat which is the most popular](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.andchat&amp;hl=en)\n- Windows: [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com) - or [HexChat](http://hexchat.github.io/) - or [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/)\n- Mac: Once again, either the link above or a dedicated program like [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/)\n- Linux: [xchat](http://silverex.org/) or [HexChat](http://hexchat.github.io/)\n\nIn most IRC clients, once open you can type /server irc.snoonet.org then once connected you can type /join #WritingPrompts",

Some real life stuff came up and had to be handled.  Anyway!  I'll be messaging the winners to discuss the terms of how we'll settle the tie and update this thread accordingly.  Thanks everyone and check back soon for more details about the winners!  \n\n**Update #2** - I have messaged both winners and am waiting on responses.  For anyone who might be curious, right now we are discussing either splitting the winnings (both users get 2 months of gold) or having a tie-breaker in a separate thread.  Thanks to everyone else who participated in the contest!  Lots of really great responses and it was a blast chatting with you guys during the broadcast.  I think it's safe to call this one a success.  :) \n\n**Final Update** - After a bit of discussion, our winners have decided to split the prize!  Congrats to /u/Ashome , /u/StoryboardThis and all who helped make the Bigass Music Prompt a success!  See you guys next time!\n_______________________\n\nYou know what I like and don't see enough of?  Music prompts.  That's why I've put together one bigass playlist to move you and groove you and get those creative juices sloshing around like never before!  So how does it work?  Read on.\n\n**How it Works**\n\nWhen this post is one hour old, I will update this thread with a link to a really big playlist I've put together on [Grooveshark](http://grooveshark.com).  You don't have to be here then.  In fact, it might be more interesting if you jump in at some random point afterwards and start writing to whatever you hear.  Either way, it's simple:  listen to the broadcast and start writing.  Or make a sandwich with the volume at full blast until you hear something that moves you, *then* start writing.  \n\nFor those of you who may be unfamiliar with Grooveshark, take a minute to familiarize yourself with it (it's really simple) and feel free to sign up for an account if you'd like to chat with me in the broadcast window.  I'll be around for as long as the broadcast is going, and the playlist I've put together is ~~probably better~~ definitely more than an hour of solid tunes.  Some of it's ambient, some of it's groovy, some of it's easy-listening space funkadelica, and who knows, I might even be open to adding your request into the mix!  \n\n**Guidelines**\n\nEntries must be no more than 400 words.  There is no topic, however, you must provide the name (or names, if there's more than one) of the songs you used for inspiration.  Grooveshark lets you link to individual songs from the playlist, so feel free to do that too if you'd like to share it with others.  \n\n**Voting**\n\nThe winner will be decided via closed vote in this thread.  Only those who submit an entry can vote on the winner, and you can vote for your pick any time after the contest starts.  Just respond with something like 'My Vote!' to the entry you'd like to vote for.  \n\n**The Prize**\n\nThree, count'em, three solid months of precious reddit gold!\n\nI think that covers it!  If you have any questions or issues, feel free to message me. \n\nWoo!\n\n_________________\n\n**It's On!**\n\n~~Join the broadcast [here](http://grooveshark.com/#!/withviolence/broadcast)!~~  \n\n[Here's a link](http://grooveshark.com/playlist/Music+Prompt+Contest+02+14/95316934) to the final version of the playlist - exactly 50 songs to choose from, some recommended by users listening and chatting during the live broadcast.  The contest will officially close when this post is 25 hours old.  Good luck and thanks to all who joined in during the broadcast!",

            "selftext": "\"Wake up! Time to die!\" Something soft hits me across the face and suddenly I wake up with a start, my heart pounding in my chest as I reach beneath my pillow and pull out a switchblade.\n\n\"Stay the fuck away from... Oh.\" A lanky man with a thin face is standing over my bed with a pillow in his hand, grinning like an idiot. A number 79 was floating over his head. \"Very funny, Fred.\"\n\n\"You should have seen your face!\" Fred laughed. \"You actually thought I was going to kill you. *Stay the fuck away, stay the fuck away*.\" He imitated my voice and pretended to wave a blade about. Sometimes I wonder why I ever gave him a key to the apartment. I give him a minute to calm down while I rub the sleep out of my eyes.\n\n\"So, did you just stop by to play one of your hilarious practical jokes or did you want something?\"\n\n\"Look.\" He nodded at the number over my head. \"You've got a promotion.\" I looked up, dreading what I'd find. 22. Last night it was 26.\n\n\"Here.\" Fred threw himself in the couch and turned on the TV. \"It's all over the news.\" The screen flickered on and sure enough, a woman was talking about a series of well coordinated murders that had taken place last night all over the country.\n\n\"The victims, including New York politician Ethan Williams, number 23, were all found dead in their homes late last night. Some people speculate that the murders may be related to the victim's numbers, 19, 21, 22 and 23, though there is no evidence to support this theory.\" I turned off the TV as the woman on the news began talking about the weather.\n\n\"'May be related to their numbers', gee, you think?\" Fred grinned, this whole thing was a joke to him, it was easy for him to joke, nobody wanted to kill him, he probably had another year before he got near the top. \"They should just make it legal to kill people in the top 50, make them lawless or something. Let them sort themselves out.\"\n\n\"Yeah, brilliant.\" I replied in a shaky voice. I felt like I was going to throw up. \"There's so many killings that we should just make it legal. That'll solve the problem.\" I got up and took a briefcase from under my bed, it was mostly packed already.\n\n\"So what's your plan now, Mr. 22? How are you going to take out the others?\" Fred followed me and glared over my shoulder as threw some clothes into the briefcase.\n\n\"I'm not. I'm going.\"\n\n\"Going? Where's your ambition, man?\" \n\n\"My ambition is to stay alive and to do that I need to get as far away from here as possible. Find somewhere quiet where no one can find me.\" I rummaged through my sheets, but I couldn't find my switchblade anywhere.\n\n\"C'mon.\" Fred insisted. \"Don't you want to be number one? Just imagine man, money, women, cars, anything you want! You'd be a god, and you're so close!\"\n\n\"Murdering 21 people, that's close to you? Have you seen my blade?\" Fred shrugged.\n\n\"Well, hopefully I won't need it where I'm going.\" I threw the briefcase over my shoulder and walked out the door with Fred on my heels.\n\n\"Anyway, you probably wouldn't have to kill them all by your self. They'd do half the work for you.\"\n\n\"I'm lucky I lived this long. Even if I could kill all those people, which I sure as hell can't, for what? To be treated like a superstar for a day and then get my throat slit at night? I think I'll pass.\" I waved down a cab and got in. Fred slipped in next to me.\n\n\"Where to?\" The cab driver peered at my through the rear-view mirror, the number 5793 over his head.\n\n\"The airport.\" He nodded and drove off.\n\n\"C'mon, you can't just leave.\" Fred urged. \"This is your chance.\"\n\n\"Yeah, this is my chance to get away. Four people died last night and if I stay, I'm next.\"\n\n\"Where are you going then?\"\n\n\"Just... away. Does it matter? If I'm ever coming back, it'll be in a body bag.\" The cab pulled into the airport. I threw the driver a few dollars and got out.\n\n\"Just tell me, man, don't you trust me?\" Fred grinned again.\n\n\"It's better if you don't know.\" I insisted and started walking towards the crowd streaming into the double doors of the airport at a brisk pace, leaving Fred behind me. The real reason I didn't want him to know is so that he wouldn't come find me if I was ever standing in the way of him and number one.\n\n\"I'm never going to see you again and I don't even get a goodbye?\" I stopped a little ways from the crowd and let Fred catch up. \"C'mere.\" He pulled me into a hug.\n\n\"Goodbye, Fred. Take care of yourself.\" I let go of him, but Fred held me firmly with his arm around me.\n\n\"I can't let you go. Even if you have no ambition, I do. This had to be done sooner or later.\" He leaned in and whispered in my ear. \"I'm going to be number one.\" I felt a stab of pain as something punctured my gut.\n\nHe let go of me and my knees caved under my weight. I collapsed to the ground, feeling waves of warm, thick blood pumping out of the wound in my stomach and soaking my clothes. Fred wiped my switchblade on his pants and winked at me.\n\n\"Goodbye, friend.\" The last thing I see before it all turns black is the number over his head changing from 79 to 78.\n\n\n\n\n",
