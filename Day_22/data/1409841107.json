To illustrate this point, and because I really like these contests that /r/WritingPrompts has been having, I'm going to be holding MY VERY OWN CONTEST, based off of *your* ideas. And this post is the first phase.\n\nI need your prompts. Specifically, your very bad ones. What are the worst, the lamest, the most terrible, and the stupidest ideas/prompts for a story that you can think of?\n\nComment with your favorite one, and, as long as I get at least thirty responses/prompts/ideas, I will hold a contest based off the top three. How will I decide which ones are the best? I won't. You will. The three prompts with the most upvotes by this Friday, the Third, at noon EST, will be the winners. And I will make a contest wherein people must write a short-story based off of all three of them. If all goes according to plan, it will be challenging, but a good test of your writing abilities.\n\nNow, for the rules: The rules for the contest itself will depend upon the response I get and how many people are interested or enthusiastic. However, the rules for this phase are as follows.\n\n* No sexually explicit prompts.\n\n* Please reply to comments with your enthusiasm, opinions, arguments or whatever you want. Only, save the top-level comments for prompts/ideas.\n\nNow, to the mods: I understand that I'm not using the tag \"[PM]\" correctly in the strictest sense of the word, but I hope that you will see that this would be in the spirit of the subreddit, and that this tag is the most appropriate for what I'm trying to do. Also, I promise I won't promise anything (such a prizes) unless I am able to deliver on that promise.\n\nAlright, lets see what happens!",

I'm working on an ad campaign for a medium sized restaurant chain in the midwest who's biggest product is their Philly Cheesesteak, and I'm having some writer's block. So here's what's going down.\n\nI need you to write a 15-30 second commercial for America's Best Philly, here are some good bullet points from the brand: \n\n- Fresh ingredients\n\n- They grill the food in front of you when you order it, like subway except they cook all of the meats upon order, right there at the counter.\n\n- The star of the brand is the Philly, but they also do burritos, salads, rice bowls, and nachos.\n\n- Additionally we're looking for something that can be stretched out into a longer campaign, like Geico's Caveman, or Wendy's \"Where's the Beef\"\n\n\n- Tag lines at the end are appreciated.\n\n\n- Bonus points for funny. My client really loved K-Marts \"Ship My Pants\": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I03UmJbK0lA\n\n\n\nNow, down to the brass tax, the cash prizes. The first prize is $50, by 11:59 CST on Wednesday 10/1/14, I will pick 1 winner and comment on their thread, and post their idea as the winner below. I'll pay out in whatever form you guys want, PayPal, BitCoin etc. \n\nAdditionally, a second prize will be given out to any ideas that we actually incorporate into the ad campaign. That Prize will $100, and we may award this to more than one redditor. This will be a bit farther down the road. \n\nOnce the campaign is finished I will post the final product(s) here and notify all Second Prize winners. If this works well, I'll do it again. If you guys don't like it, I won't. I'm putting this in your hands reddit. ",

And to randomly sort. Etc. Etc. Etc. [Here's a subtle plug for my book which helps fund some of these contests.](http://www.amazon.com/1-000-Awesome-Writing-Prompts-ebook/dp/B00JOVSYC2/ref=sr_1_40?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1399036355&amp;sr=1-40&amp;keywords=writing+prompts) Also available in [softcover!](http://www.amazon.com/1-000-Awesome-Writing-Prompts/dp/150091066X/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1399036355&amp;sr=1-40))\n\nAll in all, this was a thrilling adventure. You were all so creative!\n\nFor these contests, to ease your task of reading and voting, we do two rounds. The first round, people are grouped together randomly. The second round will be the winners of the first round competing against each other with EVERYONE from the first round voting. \n\nIf you still desire a critique of your writing, you can submit 250 word excerpts to /r/WritingCritiques. \n\nI also recommend /r/shortstories,  /r/allnightwriters, /r/shutupandwrite or /r/destructivereaders for longer pieces - but read their sidebar rules first!\n\nIf you want to see the original entry thread with the prompt, go here: http://redd.it/2gzn1s\n\n---------------------------\n\n**HOW TO VOTE**\n\n- Read all the entries in the group you belong to.\n- Decide which one you like the most.\n- Post in response to this thread **by October 5th at 11:59PM PST**.\n- **YOU MUST VOTE!** If you do not vote, you are disqualified! If your story is the most voted for in your group and you don't vote, you are out of luck.\n- Leave a comment that says precisely this: \"GROUP LETTER: My vote goes to /u/username for Story Title.\" Replacing the word LETTER with the group you're in, username for the persons username and Story Title with the title of the story they wrote. After that you can add any additional comments about that story and the other stories in your group. Feel free to say a runner up if it was really close in your mind.\n- You cannot vote for yourself!\n\nAfter we have a winner for each group, we move on to the second round of voting which will last one week where everyone who entered can vote for the winner out of the remaining entries.\n\nTie breakers are decided by myself and /u/SurvivorType, though we might just have any ties, if there are only one or two,  move on to round two. We'll play it by ear as we always do.\n\n**GROUP A**\n\n- [The People We Push Away](/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2h238e/pi_the_people_we_push_away_1ml_contest_entry/) - /u/Bipoloroid\n- [Feelum Karum Koolum Tarum](/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2hibs3/pi_feelum_karum_koolum_tarum_1ml_contest_entry/) -

So, I thought we could create a sub exactly for that purpose. We could continue each others entries or give the author somewhere to expand a story if they wish to. I, personally would love to see where some of the original ideas lead to when continued by someone else. What do you think?\n\nEdits: \n\n1. Feel free to suggest rules/guidelines for the new sub. As this is the first sub I'm to found, I'll also gladly accept help if any of you want to become mods.\n\n2. As /u/RyanKinder and /u/Cylleruion pointed out, similar subreddits already exist. I've checked them and think that due to posting policies /r/storyjams is the one that could become what I was thinking about. However, I'd like to have the continued stories restricted to /r/writingprompts.\n\n3. /r/tobecontinued is already taken but inactive. I'll contact the founder to see if she'd like to join us or let us take over the sub.\n\n4. I just remembered that /u/Zyrian150 has founded /r/longwritingprompts about a month ago for the exact purpose I stated above. That's actually where I might've gotten the idea from. Credit where credit is due! Yet this sub is inactive as well, thus I'll see what we can do. I intend on bundling forces, maybe we can merge the existing subs into one big, shiny new world. Anyone who can come up with a stylish sub name is welcome!\n\n5. Result of (2) to (4): I'll see what the owners of /r/tobecontinued, /r/storyjams and /r/longwritingprompts think about collaborating and give you an update once I have an answer.\n\n---\n\nUpdate: We've got /r/tobecontinued, see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2hsugt/ot_update_on_rtobecontinued/).\n\n",

Any help with these in addition to any and all constructive criticism regarding the story itself (and my storytelling) is very much welcomed. I do hope you enjoy.*\n\n\n**\"Little Monsters\"**\n\n**1**\n\nYou live as long as I have, you get to doing things you wish you\u2019d done differently, right? See things you wish you hadn\u2019t. My life is like that. Everytime I close my eyes. Can\u2019t go more than a few hours sleep before I find myself waking up in a sweat, crying maybe. And sometimes I find myself praying maybe God\u2019ll have mercy on me one of these nights and let me slip away before I get to remembering what I wish I could forget.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the funny thing of it all, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019ve lived a good life. Been a good man best I could. Went to church every week. Got myself a job and a wife and kept a roof over our heads. Not a beautiful, big home, sure, but we were happy. We\u2019d squabble about money like any couple at the end of the month when things were getting a bit tight. But we made it through all that. Not a lot of money in being a janitor, really. And if I had any regrets in that part of my life, I wish I\u2019d been a smarter man, get myself a better job and buy my wife all the things she deserved. Not easy being the wife of a man who cleans up toilets at a high school. You get a lot of looks, ya know? They point and whisper at you sometimes. Not just the kids--their moms and dads too. Awful thing. But it was a job. And that was our life. And we made the best of what we had in the end.\n\nShe was the one that made it all tolerable, really--my Isa. Sweetest thing in the world. She\u2019d be stubborn as a mule at times, but what woman isn\u2019t? And my Isa had plenty reason to behave like that, what with her being married to me and all. I was never the smartest man. Certainly wasn\u2019t the most sociable--most nights I\u2019d come home and she\u2019d want to go out after being cooped up in our little house all morning and afternoon and I\u2019d just want to sit down in front of the television set with a beer. God bless her, she\u2019d bring me my beer and sit right there with me nine times out of ten. And the whole time she\u2019d listen to me go on and on about this and that, about the messes I cleaned up that day--girls making a mess of the washroom while everyone else was in class, or some kid getting worked up real bad during gym and the mess he made all over the basketball court. And I\u2019d get into real detail about all it and rant and rave for a good hour or more and she\u2019d just sit there, my beer in her hand--and sometimes she\u2019d even take a sip now and then if I was going good enough, too--and she\u2019d just listen. By the end of the night, I\u2019d be falling asleep with her right there next to me, and she\u2019d be running her fingers through my hair, telling me it\u2019ll be alright. And nine times out of ten, I believed her.\n\nBut Isa\u2019s gone now. Buried her couple years back, right up there in Rose Hills with her mother and sisters. Sometimes I go up there and tell her everything that\u2019s been nagging at me like I used to. Take a little chair and blanket and even a beer, and I sit right there with her until they tell me I have to go. It\u2019s just not the same, though--I know that. I know she\u2019s not there. Not really. What\u2019s her is gone. All that\u2019s left is a big box in the ground, buncha bones wrapped in her prettiest clothes. Probably just tatters now, right?\n\nBut it helps, mostly. Maybe it\u2019s the routine, going through the motions and talking it out like we\u2019d do at home. I don\u2019t really know. All I know is that it helps some.\n\nI probably sound like a lonely old man just prattling on. And maybe that is what I am. And you got every right wondering what\u2019s all I\u2019ve said got to do with what I came here to tell you about. And it\u2019s like I said, I can\u2019t go many hours at night without waking up in a cold sweat. Without my Isa, there isn\u2019t much of anything what makes my life all too tolerable. Telling her what I did made it easier to sleep at night--made it easier to keep on living, really. But there were things I didn\u2019t tell her. Sure, I told her most everything, even a few things I might have been better off keeping to myself. But there were some things that I couldn\u2019t tell her, because it just wouldn\u2019t have been fair to put that sort of awfulness on her mind.\n\n**2**\n\nI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019re quite old enough to remember a story of a boy by the name of Roland McKinney. Probably not, right? It was in all the papers twenty, twenty-five years ago. Awful thing. Not that you\u2019d know it these days, what with how most people seem to have forgotten all about Roland. It happens given enough time, ya know. People forget all that awfulness they read in the paper. They move on with their lives. They grow up, grow old. Some even die--like my Isa. Too busy living and dying to remember old stories like Roland\u2019s.\n\nBut I remember. Because I was there. I saw a lot of what those kids did to Roland over the years. Awful little monsters doing awful little things. You\u2019d think what with the way they talk about bullying in the news these days--on the television and in your paper--you\u2019d be forgiven to think they went and invited it in the last decade. Thing is, you just see it more. All those kids record what they does to one another and just put it up on the internet for the whole damned world to see. The way they mock and torment some poor kid until he goes and strings himself up--that isn\u2019t new. Been going on for years and years. Far as I know or can tell, children have always been playing with each other like cats playing with their food. They tenderize whoever they\u2019ve picked with all the names and taunting and all that, get them stewing in their own fear juices. Eventually the poor kid just decides enough is enough and ends it in the only way he can think of.\n\nAnyway, I saw what they\u2019d done to Roland so I can\u2019t quite forget it as easy like everybody else has. Lord knows I pray that I could. But every night these days it seems Roland is right there waiting for me. And I suppose if you knew Roland like most people did, that might not be the worse thing to see at night. He was a quiet boy, real soft spoken most of the time. Always well-dressed too. Also a bit \u201clight in the loafers\u201d, at least that\u2019s how we\u2019d say it back when I was in school. You could see the kid was gay as the day was long when he came bouncing down the halls. But he was a beautiful young man. Had these big doe eyes that just seemed to sparkle in the light. If he\u2019d had a thing for girls instead of boys, there might not have been a weekend go by where he wasn\u2019t putting it to a different one. I don\u2019t suppose things like that mattered to me much if any. None of my business who might be sticking what inside of whoever else. But that\u2019s now how the kids saw it. Not at all.\n\nSee, most of the time it was typical childish bullshit like name calling and all that. Didn\u2019t seem anyone, least of all the teachers cared much to do anything about it. Roland would be in the hallway or at a table at lunch, and you\u2019d just hear some little shithead call him a fag and keep on walking away, yucking it up with his shithead friends. Once in a while you might\u2019ve heard some teacher or another speak up, tell the shithead to keep his thoughts to himself. Never made him apologize, though. Just told him to keep it to himself.\n\nI suppose most teachers just give up on caring after a point, right? They have to deal with this sort of shit day after day, hundreds of students every year. They can\u2019t keep track of it all. Sort of keeps them all at a distance, like ants under a magnifying glass. And after the novelty of teenage drama grows old they just sort of let it become background noise. Just want to make it through the day and get home. I know that feeling, ya know. You just want to get home to your wife smelling a little less like shit and bleach, drink a beer while she tells you everything will be okay. So I sort of get it, I guess.\n\nBut what I don\u2019t understand is how people can turn a blind eye to a kid in need of help. For the first year or so I\u2019d see Roland pushing through it all. Kept his head high. Kept his clothes pressed. Kept that bounce in his step. But cruelty has a way of changing you, rotting you all from the inside out. You keep all those negative thoughts and feeling bottled up inside you, but the human body isn\u2019t made of plastic and glass. It just eats away at your gut--I know that. Got the ulcers to prove it. But it also eats at the mind. Depression, anxiety. All that stuff can come about for anyone given they hold a lot of those negative thoughts and feeling in them. Breaks them down slowly over time. And that\u2019s what happened to Roland too. By the end of his sophomore year he was barely keeping his shirt tucked in and his hair styled. You\u2019d see him slouching as he walked, looking out of the corner of his eyes and clutching his satchel tight to his chest. You\u2019d think he was walking in a bad neighborhood at night, but it was just school.\n\nWhat I remember most about Roland is this one time, probably in the winter of his junior year. I\u2019d been cleaning up one of those messes I told you about, girls making an absolute sight of their washroom. You\u2019d think the girls were the cleaner of the two, the way they always fuss about their hair and clothes and all that. But the boys are a lot cleaner in some ways. They might pee a bit on the seat or on the floor, but you never see them smearing blood and other worse bodily fluids all over the stalls and walls. It\u2019s something awful, really. And the smell, if you aren\u2019t used to, I suppose, that smell is about the most awful thing a man can take in. I\u2019d been doing that for too long and ran out of that girl\u2019s washroom. Didn\u2019t even think that maybe I\u2019d run into somebody, knock \u2018em over and all that. But that\u2019s just what happened. I\u2019m gagging and coughing and feeling sick to my stomach as I stumbled out there into the hall, and, bam, I knock poor Roland ass over teakettle.\n\nI get worked up thinking about this, ya know? Not even when I\u2019m sleeping at night, because all that business is what comes later. But I get worked up thinking about Roland there on the floor, his books everywhere and him looking a mess. And I think it\u2019s because I remember his eyes. Big doe eyes, remember? Like a baby seeing the world new for the first time. But they were so dark and tired that day I ran into him. Dark circles under his eyes. Bloodshot. Maybe he\u2019d been crying. Maybe he hadn\u2019t been sleeping well. I don\u2019t know any of that. But what I do know is he just looked so tired of life.\n\nThere are things we all wish we could go back and do different. You live long enough and you begin to acquire regrets like my wife acquired little trinkets, enough to fill a closet. Maybe even a garage if you\u2019re life turns out a bit worse than most. And, for me, this was one of those very things. I helped him up, said I was sorry for not looking where I was going and knocking him over like that. Don\u2019t think that I didn\u2019t. Or that me not doing so was what I regret, because it\u2019s not. What I regret is that this is all I did. I helped him up, dusted him off, and even picked up his books. And then I sent him on his way. I saw how bad that boy was hurting, saw how tired he looked, but I said nothing about any of that. Couldn\u2019t think to do it. I was no better than that teacher who told the little shithead to keep his \u201cfaggot\u201d comment to himself. I just stood there and watched it happen without another thought. And then I went home to my wife and she gave me a beer and ran her fingers through my hair and told me everything would be alright.\n\nRoland McKinney was found dead in his home during that year\u2019s winter break, about three weeks after I\u2019d run into him. He was sixteen years old. \n\nI don\u2019t know how he died exactly, because the paper never reported it, what with Roland being a minor and all. Heard rumors that he\u2019d gone and slit his wrists in the tub. Others say he got up in the dead of night, got in his parent\u2019s car, and ran the motor with the windows rolled up and the garage door closed. But that\u2019s all those were, just rumors. Only two things I really know about Roland\u2019s death is that he died alone and that I didn\u2019t do anything to stop it. That\u2019s it.\n\n**3**\n\nIt\u2019s a bit funny, really. They removed all the lockers at the school quite a few years back. All the parents were afraid of the children hiding guns and drugs and whatever else in there. It never crossed their mind that their own children might be the ones storing things in there. A parent wants to believe that their child is incapable of harming another living soul. It\u2019s always some other little bastard running around stabbing and shooting and drugging up the place. It doesn\u2019t even cross their mind that the worst things these kids do to each other can\u2019t ever be tucked away in a locker for later. It\u2019s the things they say and do to one another. It\u2019s the way they use the cameras and apps on their phones, the ones they keep in their pockets. This is what they use to ruin another kid\u2019s life.\n\nBut back then they still had them--the lockers, that is. And every year I\u2019d have to clean them all out. Sometimes it was like gutting a small animal, the way everything would just fall out of those damned things, get everything all wet and sticky. Nasty things, lockers.\n\nAnyway, after Roland\u2019s passing, I was the one who had to empty his locker out early. And then, just like now, the worst things those kids did to each other wasn\u2019t inside the locker, but the outside.\n\nFirst thing was the most obvious, really. It might even be the worst, depending on how you look at things. See, all those years the kids mostly avoided Roland. Left the poor boy to go and keep to himself. At best he was ignored; at worst\u2026well, they drove him do whatever it is he did to himself that winter. They knew this. I knew this. Whole school just about knew this, ya know? So imagine my surprise when I saw all these notes and pictures posted up around his locker after everyone came back from school. \u201cWE LOVE YOU, ROLAND\u201d and \u201cYOU\u2019LL BE MISSED\u201d and some old class photos with Roland tucked away in some back corner. All a bunch of bullshit, if you ask me. These kids didn\u2019t give two shits if Roland made it through the day, and they sure didn\u2019t care much for him now that he was dead. Maybe one of them did. But the rest just wanted in on it, like it were some kinda fad to tell the dead kid you missed him. Didn\u2019t want to be the only one who didn\u2019t, because what might everyone else think?\n\nI think the most honest thing I found there was some kid\u2019s handwriting. Scratched, \u201cEAT SHIT IN HELL\u201d right there on Roland\u2019s locker door. It was covered up with some of those notes and whatever, but it was still there. And that\u2019s funny, too, right? Because people at that school will look at it and think to themselves how they wished they\u2019d had the balls to do what this kid did, to write \u201cEAT SHIT IN HELL\u201d on a dead kid\u2019s locker when nobody else was looking. Instead they just write a note real quick and cover things up.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I had to do first thing back after hearing all about Roland. After listening to my Isa carry on about that poor queer kid from my school that killed himself. After lying to her for just about the first time ever, telling her that I didn\u2019t have a clue who that boy was. If I\u2019d told her that I knew him, that I\u2019d gone and done nothing at all to help that poor kid, I don\u2019t know what she might have thought of me. Maybe she would have looked at me different those last twenty or so years of her life. Maybe she\u2019d have stopped playing with my hair and telling me everything would be alright, because she\u2019d know it wouldn\u2019t be. Because I\u2019d just stood there and told that poor broken boy to run off to class without so much as tussling his hair and telling him it\u2019d be alright. In all honesty, right now I\u2019m not better than those kids who covered up that scratching with their notes.\n\nI dumped all those cards and pictures into one box. I opened and put everything of Roland\u2019s into another. I scrubbed and cleaned that locker of several months of whatever sticky mess it is that lines everything teenagers own and touch. I did that and painted that locker door best I could to remove any sign that somebody had written their nasty little thoughts. They\u2019d have no choice but to keep it to themselves from now on.\n\nAnd it was as I was finishing up there, picking up those boxes and walking back to the office, that I found that second thing I mentioned before--the other worst thing found outside a locker. It wasn\u2019t a knife or a bag of weed, or anything like that. Though given all the shit that poor boy went through, I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if I\u2019d found either.\n\nNo, it was this small photo tucked there in all those papers and hair products and other junk Roland had in his locker. At first I thought it was just one of those old class pictures everyone had put up there on his locker, but there were no smiling kids or Roland sitting in some corner fussing over his hair. You remember those old Polaroids, the kind you shake and the picture sorta just appears right there in front of you? It was one of those, I think. But it was in black and white, and I don\u2019t think they were making those anymore then. At least it looked black and white--that\u2019s what really made it stand out, I guess. All the other pictures were in color, but this was just washed out and black and white. No real color that I could see. Looked like a lot of crossed wires and little shadows set against the sun. Sorta like one of them dreamcatchers, ya know? Isa always kept one of those up in our window. Said it\u2019d help me sleep better at night. Don\u2019t do much but gather dust these days. But it reminds me of my Isa, so I keep it there.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why I stopped and bothered with that photo. It wasn\u2019t mine to bother with. But there I was fussing with some poor dead kid\u2019s things, invading his privacy. Curiosity is what I\u2019ve told myself all this time. My mind had to know it was that was there in the picture. It sort of looked like those dreamcatchers, but it was so out of focus and washed out and dark that I\u2019d no way of knowing without getting a better look. Not that it did me any good. I stood there for what might\u2019ve been a good five minutes trying to figure that thing out. Just light and shadow was what I saw. And all I could think of was why Roland would bother keeping such an awful picture. You\u2019d think he\u2019d just take another one, right? Not hard to imagine him sitting there, taking that one picture, then waiting a couple minutes for it to develop and then seeing it was shit. Just take another one. That\u2019s what I\u2019d do. You too probably, yeah? Of course. Anybody would just take another picture. So it must\u2019ve been something important to the boy. Important enough to not bother with another and to keep it there in his locker like that.\n\nAnd my mind\u2019s trying to wrap itself around all that when Mr. Anderson pops his head outside his classroom and gives me a startle. Mr. Anderson was one of the English teachers there at the school, and I guess he\u2019d had some extra time on his hands, so he stuck his head out to ask me to empty his trash for him. Nearly gives me an infarction right there and then, the way he just called out for me. I told him I\u2019d get right on it after I got these boxes to the office and he says that\u2019s fine and gets right back to whatever he did during his free period. And me, I hardly even noticed I\u2019d dropped the damned photo. It takes me a moment to even realize it\u2019s not even in my hand anymore and I\u2019m looking all around me like a fool. That\u2019s when I see it in the grass, just a few feet away. And when I pick it up I notice that there\u2019s some writing on the back. Buncha numbers that I\u2019ve long forgotten at this point--coordinates, far as I could tell right then. Didn\u2019t know to where.\n\nI can look back on that and say I\u2019d do things different, knowing what I do, but there\u2019s just no going back now, is there? What\u2019s done is done. And I gotta live with making that decision to stuff that picture into my back pocket. Took those boxes right to the front office, told them everything was in there, and walked out. Biggest mistake of my life, that. Hands-down.\n\n**4**\n\nIt was this little pillbox set in the foothills of the Santa Anas. Couldn\u2019t tell you who built it, or when. Looked like it\u2019d been there for a good forty years or more. Nothing but moss and dry grass all over it. The way the stones were laid together, packed together with mud and who knows what else, it might\u2019ve been thrown together by some kids way back when most the county was still orange groves.\n\nTook me some time to get up there. Didn\u2019t have a GPS in my cellphone back then, ya know. Didn\u2019t even have a cellphone. And it\u2019d be a long time before most people did, I think. But I found it all the same. Had me a map and a compass. Walked around up there in the hills like a goddamn boyscout. Not that my Isa knew anything about that. Told her I was going out to help a friend with some engine trouble, that we\u2019d grab a beer or two after. Isa knew I couldn\u2019t tell a spark plug from the dick in my hand, but she let me go off all the same without another word. That woman was too good to me. And I guess that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t tell her where I was going or why. Didn\u2019t want her to fuss over that nonsense. I was just a foolish man running around like some kid with a treasure map. I hope she\u2019d see it that way, at least.\n\nI remember standing there for a while. Just stood there, right in front of the damned thing. I think a part of me just wanted to go on back to my wife. Couldn\u2019t stand the thought of going inside that little pillbox. Maybe the damned thing would come crashing down on top of me. It didn\u2019t look like it\u2019d still be standing the way those stones just sort of stuck out all over the place. It was stuck together with mud and shit far as I could tell. And even if it didn\u2019t crush me like a roach under a boot, I didn\u2019t know what I might find in there. Could just be a frightened kid\u2019s little fortress of solitude that he had stumbled upon, made it his own. Maybe Roland had a bunch of pin ups all up on the walls. Stack of magazines in the corner--filled with all those wrestling guys or boy bands or whatever he was fond of. Shit, maybe just some fashion magazines. Whatever he needed to feel...not normal, because even if the kid was a bit light in the loafers he was still a normal kid. Went to school. Had parents. Worried about looking good and fitting in. All that shit kids fuss over and deal with, ya know? But at least comfortable in his own skin here, maybe. Miles away from the shitheads that call him a fag and scratch horrible things in his locker door.\n\nNot that I was one to give a shit about the kid\u2019s privacy, right? I\u2019d already gone through his locker. Looked and touched all his private things there. Stole one of his pictures even and come up here--whatever here might be.\n\nMaybe if I\u2019d done the right thing and just turned away and burned that goddamned Polaroid of his I\u2019d be able to sleep better at night. Maybe talking to Isa up in Rose Hills would do me a bit of good. That dreamcatcher of hers might be enough to wake up with the sun instead of in the dead of night.\n\nIf I\u2019d just done right by Roland all those years ago when I ran into him in that hallway, told him it\u2019d be okay. Maybe if I\u2019d done that I\u2019d never have seen what I seen.\n\nBut all these maybes don\u2019t mean a damned thing now, because I did go up to that little pillbox. I did open that door. And nothing I saw in that pillbox should have surprised me any...except that\u2019s exactly what it did. No posters of shirtless men. No mirror for Roland to look into when he\u2019d do his hair the way he liked. Just shadows and light and the artwork of a boy so far gone and lost that he saw no value in life. The animals skins stretched taut dangled from the roots and weed that hung from the ceiling of that pillbox, dangling there in the breeze like Isa\u2019s dreamcatcher. The bones rattled like windchimes. A crude table in the corner where I\u2019d hoped magazines would be, half-skinned bodies stacked high. The smell of necrotic flesh stinging at my nose. The buzzing of flies filling my ears. And the shadows and light dancing together across it all while my heart beat quick-quick in my chest.\n\n**5**\n\nRemember when I said to you that all that fear and pain and sorrow and anger is toxic to a man? How the human body isn\u2019t made of the plastic and glass that I stored all my cleaning products in--the sort of shit that can strip the bark off wood. It poisons a man\u2019s mind. Rots the body from the inside out and erodes a man\u2019s soul. What I saw there in that pillbox wasn\u2019t the work of the doe-eyed boy with perfect hair, the one I\u2019d see bouncing along down the hall to his English class with Mr. Anderson. That pillbox was filled with the unbridled rage and sorrow of a soul stripped down to a raw nerve.\n\nI burned that pillbox and everything in it to ash. Got my little red gas tank outta the back of my truck and poured it out to the last drop. And then I lit that summanabitch up and watched the flames take it all.\n\nI ain\u2019t proud of what I\u2019d done. And I might never sleep well at night knowing what I\u2019d failed to do for Roland. Can\u2019t close my eyes for long without seeing what those children turned him into. Sometimes I just stay up late at night, alone in my bed and staring out the window with Isa\u2019s dreamcatcher. I just lie there in the dark, wondering what those kids would feel knowing they killed that boy long before he knew it. What was Roland was long gone before winter break, and all that was left just a buncha bones dressed in his best clothes.\n\nNo, I didn\u2019t ask you here to tell you all this so I could feel better. No helping that, ya know. It\u2019s eaten away what it will at this point is all I can hope for. But maybe, just maybe--after all these years they had to forget about poor Roland--those kids will read your paper and know what I know. I never let my Isa be troubled by all these memories I have. Never let it poison her like it has me. She was the one made all this tolerable. But my Isa is gone now, just like Roland. And I just don\u2019t care to keep all this poison inside me anymore. Let all those little monsters deal with it--they\u2019re all adults now. Fuck the lot of \u2018em.",
