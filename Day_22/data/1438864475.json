I've never published anything before, so this is both thrilling and *very* nerve wracking. This subreddit has literally changed my life in unimaginable ways, and I think this is just the first big step for me. I am so grateful for all of the inspiration that I get here, and all of the feedback and encouragement from all of the readers. If you decide to pick up a copy, I really hope you enjoy the book! And as always, there is plenty more in /r/Luna_Lovewell, so you should subscribe there!\n\nAlso, if you enjoyed the book, consider leaving a review as well!\n\nEdit: Now with [epub and PDF versions!](https://gumroad.com/l/Drca) (you get them both with that link)\n",

            "selftext": "This workshop brought to you by our lovely Arch15! (Would you expect anyone else?) I am but a humble messenger, spreading his word.\n\n---\n\nWelcome to the weekly Writing Prompts writing workshop! This workshop, part of the schedule on /r/WritingPrompts, will be held each Wednesday!\n\n***\n[**Workshop Archive**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/writing_tips)\n-\nPoetry is something I personally love. Often times, it speaks more than a story, gives more of a message, and honestly get's straight to the point. Symbolism, rhyming, metaphors, scales, timing. Everything seems to be against you when you create poetry; but it's not. You can create your own scale, forget about rhyming, say something clearly, without obscuring it. Give it enough of a change, and writing poetry can help the way you write short stories, allowing them a flow you couldn't have given them before. Or help to expand your vocabulary, and use rhyming to your advantage. \n\nExercise\n-\nToday, you're going to write a poem. Read the prompt, and don't think too long on how you're going to plan it out. Start with one line, then keep going. Don't think about it. Then, when you know you're done, post it, no matter how bad you think it may be.\n\nPer usual, ***I will be providing the prompt, so please no past poems.*** **30 words minimum.** Keep to the sidebar rules, and please post questions only as needed, as to keep non story replies from rising to the top.\n\n***\nPrompt\n-\n&amp;gt; *Don't leave. Please.*\n\n***\nHappy writing! \n\nYou can comment on some other's writing, telling them what you think. It's not required, but it's always nice to hear.\n\n\nRemember, these workshops are open to **everybody**! Come and join the challenge! \n\n---\n---   \n\nTIPS\n-\n* **Formatting:**    \nTwo to four spaces after a sentence allows you to negate the automatic space that Reddit requires (by pressing enter twice).  \nAdding four spaces before and after your sentence allows you to unformat your sentence completely.\nOne asterisk before and after your word or sentence allows italics, two allows bold, and three is italicized bold.\n\n* ***It's poetry! Do what you feel is right for you.***\n\n\n\n***\n*** \n\nREMINDER: PLEASE KEEP YOUR REPLIES SFW.\n---\n***IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO WRITE A NSFW REPLY, THEN PLEASE LOOK AT RULE 4 BELOW.***\n\n**RULE 4:**\n&amp;gt;Erotica or 18+ prompts must be marked NSFW. Additionally, all NSFW responses to non-NSFW prompts must be posted separately as a [PI] post and marked NSFW.\n\n***\n***Big thanks to whoever posts this this week as I am off on a trip to the city.***\n\n^Oh, ^Arch15, ^you ^shouldn't ^have. ^*Blush*",

She owns a cupcake shop and for the month of September we are doing a month long fundraiser for him and his family. He is completely in love with superheroes. I am not great with stories and instead of just listing facts I thought it would be cool to have a fun superhero story about the two of them that has the facts inside as a flyer for people interested.  \n  \nThe story must include these characters:  \n- The Real McKoy - This will be the main character as McKoy is the child with cancer. My boss really likes this as his super hero name.  \n- Captain Sawyer - His twin brother. I was kind of thinking that his twin brother turned to the super world to help his superhero brother out? But am okay with any ideas and direction you go as long as he's his right hand man.  \n- The villain is unnamed so have fun but it needs to be family friendly.  \n  \nThis is his medical story and my boss would like as much used as possible but I understand if you can't include all of it in the story.  \n- McKoy was diagnosed with a stage 4 Wilms tumor in July 2014 on his kidney. It had also metastasized in his lungs &amp; lymph nodes.  \n- He underwent 10 months of chemo &amp; 8 days of radiation. In April 2015 he rang the bell celebrating the end of chemo and no evidence of Cancer.  \n- May 2015 he went back to the hospital due to severe headaches and they found out he had a tumor on his brain. Came back as a Wilms tumor.  \n- The tumor was removed successfully June 2015.  \n- Before starting treatment he went on his Make A Wish trip.  \n- He is currently doing a combination of outpatient and inpatient chemo combined with 18-proton radiation treatments. At the end of it all he will undergo a stem cell transplant.  \n- Wilms in the brain is very rare: affecting only 0.5% of Wilms patients. Although the cure rate for McKoy is low at 10-15%, his oncologists are going for a full cure.  \n  \nI have some pictures so you can have a reference of what he looks like. The flyers will be by his huge display that I'm making. \nhttp://imgur.com/a/7AHE6  \n  \nI know this is a lot of information and may be difficult so I understand if this just isn't feasible but figured I'd reach out and try.  Thank you!!  \n  \nEDIT: If I use your story I will send you a PM asking for your real name or user name (assuming it is appropriate for a child's story) to give you credit. If you do not wish to be credited then I will put Anonymous. :)  \n  \nEDIT 2: If you want to follow his progress as he goes to battle feel free to do so [here](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Team-McKoy/1455989124659414?fref=ts).\n\nEDIT 3: These are amazing! Thank you guys so much for this. When my boss comes in today I'm going to let her read them and decide. I showed my coworkers and we loved all of them... So this is definitely going to be tough. This is definitely better than anything I could have come up with. I'll keep you guys updated on what we decide and will send a PM to get info to give credit. I also can't wait to show his mom. She herself is a superwoman by taking all of this like a pro and keeping herself together to care for all 5 of her kids. I know she'd give each of you guys the biggest hug if she could for these amazing stories. &lt;3",

The Planetary Union could not enforce sanctions nor punishments so breaches of interplanetary treaties were dealt simply by issuing letters of protest. What was out there was largely finders, keepers. \n\nSpace exploration became the trade of the greedy. Asteroids and dwarf planets rich in rare elements were the most common valuable finds. Planets and moons with suitable gravity were nice too - saves the costs from artificial gravity when establishing colonies. Sometimes explorers would find life and sell those coordinates to biotech corporations and guilds. Some explorers were greedy of power and established colonies to build their own utopias to rule as kings and queens. Human trafficking, unregulated gambling, drugs, biohacks, weapons and neural coding were popular among these colonies.\n\nSure, scientist like archaeologists, biologists and planetary scientists had interest in exploring the galaxy, finding whatever might be out there. But as the crumbling Planetary Union had more pressing issues than advancing scientific knowledge, science for the sake of science wasn't exactly the most profitable profession. Most scientists had given up their scientific careers of unraveling the secrets of the universe and the origin of humanity, instead offering their services to those willing to pay more than the negligible grants of the Planetary Union. \n\nIn addition to my engineer Drei and computer scientist Maya, my current expedition had two natural scientist, Charles, a chemist specialized in quantum spectroscopy, and Kjell, a planetary scientist. Their job in my ship was to interpret and validate data we gathered from whatever planets and rocks we would bump into. Their research helped a lot in selling coordinates of valuable locations. For them working for explorers like me was the best chance for them to believe they were still working for a noble cause.\n\nI'll admit, I didn't really care for these dreams of the scientists. I was one of the greedy ones hunting treasures out there. And I mean really greedy. I already had enough money to retire to some remote asteroid to spend the rest of my decades in luxury sipping drinks while watching comets fall into stars. Still every time I sold coordinates of some valuable new rock, the sight of a successful transfer to my account made me happy. This is what greediness is about - money for the sake of money, and I enjoyed it, almost as much as I enjoyed navigating the dark corners of our galaxy.\n\nThose dark corners, the Milky Way had a lot of them. 400 billion stars spanning hundreds of thousands of light years. Humanity wouldn't run out of new worlds to find in a long time. But never did I imagine we would find something like H-1056.\n\nIt was almost an accident really, and I have to thank Kjell for that. We were in the mid rim sector 324 degrees of the Milky Way, near the mid rim sector 330 degrees. The sector 330 of the mid rim didn't have much interest for explorers, as it was rather remote and had smaller star density than the spiral arms. Probably there wasn't much to find either, as according to some archaeologist many of the star systems there had already been exploited thousands of years ago. \n\nPerhaps these archeological views were what prompted Kjell to point our instruments to 330. He should have been monitoring our current sector 324 but instead he claimed the lower density of stars at 330 were more suitable for calibration. I didn't interfere and I'm glad for that. And of the still thousands and thousands of stars out there, computer notified how the stellar luminosity of a distant main sequence yellow dwarf called H-105 decreased just a fraction. We were witnessing a transit event, a planet crossing over the disc of the star. Kjell and Charles were quick to analyze the spectral variation in light and the size and composition of the transiting planet.\n\nReading the results, they regressed into children who just got a new toy. First I didn't understand out of their technical discussion what was going on but in their joy they were quick to share it with me. The transiting planet was a rocky planet with mass indicating gravity very likely suitable for humans. While that was not exceptional, the combination with the orbit and atmosphere deduced from spectral variation was. The planet orbited in the habitable zone of the star and the atmosphere was largely nitrogen, harmless to humans, and about a quarter of the atmosphere being oxygen - breathable and a sign of potential life as we know it. Significant amounts of water vapor and carbon dioxide were also detected. No indications of dangerous levels of other gases were observed.\n\nPotentially habitable and living planets like this are extremely rare and valuable. Only a handful have been found and wars have been fought over them. I saw a business opportunity, Kjell and Charles saw a scientific discovery. It was clear to us we had a new destination. I informed Drei and Maya about a change in plans and told them to reconfigure drives to jump to the star system H-105 near the detected planet.\n\nWhile in jumpspace, we searched the vast Planetary Union databases for information about the system H-105. Nothing except basic information about the star. No records of anyone visiting there or observing this planet. Planetary Union databases were of course incomplete, having been as subject of information wars several times during the past millennia, but nothing indicated anyone had visited this system. I again felt the excitement of wandering into the dark and seeing something in there no one has seen before, the very excitement that kept me exploring the space.\n\nArriving on the system H-105 we noted the system had eight planets and a few dwarf planets. Our planet was the sixth planet looking from interstellar space so it was designated H-1056. Other planets were three rocky planets with H-1056 in the inner system and two gas giants and two ice giants in the outer system.\n\nWhile we have yet to encounter advanced civilizations in our galaxy, we decided to be careful when getting closer to H-1056. We approached from the night side, carefully observing the planet. There were no lights in the night side, no signs of civilization. Likewise atmospheric metering did not reveal any gases which might tell of technologically advanced activity. Merely trace amounts of some radioactive elements and more complex chemicals that could be a result of some unknown natural processes. Other than a relatively large moon, the planet had no other satellites - natural or artificial. We deemed it safe to orbit to the light side of the planet.\n\nIt was beautiful. I have seen several ocean planets and H-1056 wouldn't have stood out were it not for the continents covered in vast green terrains. It was the kind of green our engineered plants of recreational spaces and terraformed colonies had. If the green terrain was similar to our plants, there must have been similar evolution with our ancestral plants. This would make H-1056 truly exceptional and perhaps one of the most valuable findings in living memory. I felt proud.\n\nWe entered the atmosphere in the northern hemisphere where the temperature seemed reasonable and continents were more common. From the altitude of several kilometers we still were unable to detect any signs of civilization. The planet however was filled with life, no question about it. Instruments again confirmed the atmosphere was completely breathable and the air pressure perfect. Gravity also was like made for humans. As an explorer I was eager to get to the surface, and the childish excitement of Kjell and Charles had overrun their scientific wariness of potential dangers - they too wanted to walk the surface. After all, we did had weapons and suits to survive in hostile environments, so some risk taking was acceptable for these undiscovered lands.\n\nFlying over vast green terrains we marveled the life of the planet. I've seen several planets with life, but this was the first one that made an impression on me. Usually life is ugly, dirty colors and unpleasant forms. Here there were majestic brown pillars, covered in dark green, towering directly to the clear blue sky. They reminded me of trees in colony gardens like a childhood memory. \nWe put our protective suits on and took some weapons - just in case. Charles had his gramm meter to analyze the local organisms. Kjell didn't really have anything to do outside, but wanted to tag along to experience this world first hand. One could say the same for me too, but I had the excuse of being the leader of this expedition.\n\nThe ship landed safely on an opening in what I would describe as a forest and I told Drei and Maya to shut down the engines. We wouldn't want to draw attention any more than necessary. Together with Charles and Kjell we stood in front of the entryway, waiting it to open. It always took painstakingly long, and seemed like an eternity since we had so much to wait for. Some pressure locks opening, steam bursting, a blade of natural light cutting the interior. Watching the ramp lower in front of us into the light felt like being born. We stepped into the light outside.\n\nExcept the ship making some slight adjustment sounds, it was rather silent. No turbulent winds, just a soft breeze. That breeze swayed colorful dots in the opening. They looked like flowers. Flowers of all shades, colors and shapes. Stars, bells, blades, tubes, like a child would have let his imagination run free. In the midst of silence suddenly we heard music. Distant strange music coming from the forests. Perhaps there was intelligent life in this planet after all.\n\nI grabbed my weapon and approached the edge of the forest and yelled \"hey\". The music stopped. I took a few steps and to my surprise the music flew towards me. It was an animal, a singing animal which was flying! It sounded like a hundred songs sung and I wanted to follow it and listen to it sing.\n\nThis planet did not frighten me. It did not disgust me, like unknown life usually does. This place felt like home, a place to live in, a place to die in. For some reason, I had the irrational feeling that I trust this place, if one even can trust places. But I trusted this place.\n\nCharles took a sample of a flower to analyze with the gramm meter. When the results came, his childish excitement turned into a blank state, as if he was watching past the gramm meter. I asked him what was it about, was something wrong.\n\n\"I just... It cannot be... It cannot be...\" he spoke to himself. half frightened, half excited, in the end not knowing what to feel. His behavior also drew the attention of Kjell.\n\n\"This flower, it has DNA - and it's related to us\" Charles uttered. Kjell didn't seem impressed.\n\n\"Well of course there's some contamination in the gramm meter. It's detecting our contamination.\"\n\nCharles took a different kind of flower. Then a third, fourth, fifth. He analyzed all of them. He found some small bugs and analyzed them. He took some soil and analyzed it. Seeing the results again and again he almost fainted, having to sit down on the ground.\n\n\"All these organism, all this life. It is all related to us. We all share the same DNA. It's not contamination\" Charles insisted, leaning his helmet on his palms in confusion. Now Kjell seemed to be on the brink of realization. He gazed around us, up to the blue sky, the sun and the crescent moon. Then it dawned to him. He grabbed his comms and contacted Maya.\n\n\"It's Kjell here. I need some information about the star system. While traveling here, did we get measurements of the orbital year and stellar day of H-1056 and the time it takes for the moon to orbit H-1056?\"\n\n\"Let me check, I'll be right back at you\", Maya replied.\n\nCharles, Kjell and I all stood like we were petrified, waiting for a final confirmation we had dared not to utter yet.\n\n\"Maya here. You'll never believe this. The orbital year of H-1056 is a bit over 365 days, meaning *the orbital year of H-1056 is approximately one year*. The solar day of H-1056 is about 24 hours, meaning it *the solar day of H-1056 approximately one day*, and the moon orbits H-1056 once about 30 days, meaning *one orbit of the moon takes about one month*.\"\n\nI heard Drei saying \"holy shit\" in the background of comms. Charles repeated it, \"holy shit\". Kjell did not know what to say, so he too said only \"holy shit\". Then Charles and Kjell burst into boundless excitement and joy.\n\n\"This is The Earth! That's why everything is genetically related to us. This is where we evolved. This is where humanity was born!\" they both rejoiced, jumping on the meadow.\n\nI didn't rejoice, for I saw something familiar in their eyes. Something I have recognized in the eyes of many other people, including myself. I saw greed in their eyes. Not greed for money, but greed for fame, greed for merit, greed for respect, greed for a place among scientist like Galilei, Newton, Einstein and R\u00e4ih\u00e4. \n\nWhile Charles and Kjell were busy with their excitement, I took off my helmet. Was it wise? Perhaps not, but as I said, I trusted this planet. I trusted The Earth. I had trusted it before I knew where we were.\n\nThe soft breeze blew out the damp air out of my suit. A kaleidoscope of sweet smells and scents filled my nose even though I had not even inhaled yet. And when I inhaled, it felt like for the first time I used my lungs. The air felt like a pillow you could lie your cheek onto, and the wind was like a cool blanket to crawl under. \n\nIt felt that for all my life I had not really enjoyed exploring the unexplored. Rather I had been searching for a place to call home. All those planets and star systems, none of them mattered any more. I had seen them, been there, but they were not mine. And I filled that hole with money. But this place. This place felt like home. It was home.\n\nI looked at Charles and Kjell again and as they trampled the meadow in joy I saw the future. Planet Earth, our home, re-discovered by humanity. A political tool for the Planetary Union to use for propaganda to strengthen its influence. Power hungry explorers establishing illegal colonies. Biotech corporations and guilds exploiting and dissecting animals an plants in order to utilize their related biochemistry. War. War on who controls the Earth. War on who gets it all, or who destroys it all before competitors get it. And I saw in the eyes of Kjell and Charles that their greed for fame and recognition was boundless, and this discovery would not be held a secret.\n\n----\n\nI had removed my protective suit completely to feel free. In the forest I stumbled upon a small creek. Clear water ran in it. I let it wash the blood off my hands and the blood diluted in the water. Even though it was cold, it felt accepting. The bird that sung a hundred songs landed on a rock on the other side of the creek. Like the stream, it didn't feel like it judged me either.\n\nI never claimed I was a good man. I still don't think I am one. But for some reason, what I did feels right. Maya, Drei, Charles nor Kjell didn't really deserve to die. But I believe The Earth was worth this.\n\nI no longer dream of a remote asteroid where to watch comets fall into a star. I have this place, where I can watch birds fly into the sunset. \n\n----\n\n*I'm not sure about the rules about PI prompts that were posted in the original prompt too, but as this was my first prompt ever in the original prompt and I kind of like it regardless of its flaws, I thought to at least try to have some exposure to this first prompt to hear some feedback. And I'd also note that English isn't my native language, so there's that if something seems oddly written.*\n",

Prompt responses, personal work, whatever you can think of is all welcome.

External links are fine, www.chapterfy.com is just one example of a good place to externally host longer stories for free. If you want criticism, ask for it!
