Also, please correct all grammar/spelling/little nits beforehand. Expect to be mercilessly teased for all typos you miss, because that is fun. If you have done that important step the focus will be on the content itself. Though, if you don't do that, it is sometimes good to hear how to improve your grammar anyway. If you are searching for something specific in a critique, write what that is (example: \"Is the character of Jack believable? Did you understand What I was describing in the second paragraph?\") and then separate those out of story questions with a linebreak (on Reddit that would be a row of six dashes ------ on its own separated by a blank line.)\nAlso, please link to the prompt your response came from.

            "selftext": "Richard Miles was a man of simple pleasures. There were only two things in this world he truly loved. The first was taking a long nice dump in a handicap toilet, preferably while clocked in at work. The way he saw it, a man in a wheelchair was already the closest thing to a cyborg, why should they get the most luxurious toilets all for themselves, too?\n\nApart from getting paid to relieve himself, the thing Richard liked most of all was statistics. He made graphs about how many times he could be expected to go to the bathroom at work the following month, how much time that might total and, of course, how much he would be paid to do so. The one thing relating to his favorite pass time he did not make into a neat column or diagram was how many people died in handicap bathrooms. If he had, he may not have been so keen on entering the handicap bathroom at work this particular Tuesday morning.\n\nWhile Richard was going about his business, probably the only one in the world who did know the latest handicap-toilet-death statistics sat outside, waiting, occasionally pulling out a small hourglass from his black robes to watch the last remaining grains of sand trickle down to the bottom. Despite having to work so much extra lately, because of the sudden 24000% spike in handicap toilet related deaths, he was in a cheerful mood today, because it was his name day.\n\nHis name, just like the man in the toilet, was Richard. Nobody had called him that since his mother passed away, though. Now, the only thing people ever called him was Death. He wasn't a big fan of the name Death. He always thought it sounded more like a title than a name. Tacky, that's what it was. The least they could do was call him the Grim Reaper, he mused while waiting, absentmindedly scratching his empty eye socket.\n\nAround this time, an elderly man with thick glasses, wearing a checked shirt and suspenders, turned a corner rolled his wheelchair into the narrow bathroom corridor. He rolled past Death without giving him so much as a glance, probably because he was not dead and therefore couldn't see him, and parked himself in front of the locked door to the toilet where Richard was sitting. The man in the wheelchair leaned against the door and listened for a moment before he spoke.\n\n\"Hello? I'm Leonard.\" He asked the door. \n\n\"Hello?\" A confused Richard replied. Richard had finished almost five minutes ago, but he remained in his seat, browsing on his phone, since his graphs estimated he had at least another two and a half minutes before anyone would notice he was gone unusually long.\n\n\"Are you handicapped, yet?\" Richard thought this a strange thing to ask a man sitting on a handicap toilet.\n\n\"I'm sitting on a handicap toilet, aren't I?\"\n\n\"That you are.\" The voice outside the door admitted. \"But you still did not answer my question.\" Richard had been caught redhanded before, and it was not an experience he would like to repeat. It may be easy to outrun them, but Richard had found that people in wheelchairs got themselves surprisingly worked up about this kind of thing and were not known to let things slide, that's why he had to leave his last two work places. In the end, he decided to resort to a tried and true tactic.\n\n\"Yes. Stepped on a land mine and lost my legs. I am so handicapped it hurts when I pee, now please leave me to wallow in self pity as I mourn the death of my limbs.\"\n\nDeath watched the scene unfold with mild curiosity, humming a tune to himself as Leonard struggled to turn in his wheelchair and unhook the weighted stainless steel axe strapped to the back of his wheelchair.\n\n\"You don't mind if I come in and check, do you?\" Before Richard had the chance to reply, the axe bit into the door, right next to the handle, almost caving it in.\n\n\"Actually, I do mind. If you could just...\" Richard realized his protests were in vain when the axe came down for the second time, leaving a gaping hole in the door through which an old man in glasses peered through.\n\n\"Tsk, tsk, tsk. There must have been some kind of mistake. I thought you didn't have any legs.\" Leonard said, smiling in a friendly manner. \"I guess we're going to have to remedy that. Wouldn't want you sitting around mourning limbs you've still got.\" With another swing of the axe the lock came off and the door swung open.\n\n\"They're prosthetics?\" Richard tried, but the axe was already on its way down. Death, or the Grim Reaper as he liked to be called, glanced at the hour glass to confirm that there were only a handful of sand grains left, got up and by the time he entered the toilet, Richard stood looking down and his own corpse, both legs  crudely severed at the hip.\n\n\"Hm. If they'd only lay still, maybe this wouldn't happen so often.\" Leonard muttered to himself, disappointed with the fatal outcome of his emergency surgery. \"Oh well, you win some you lose some.\" He said, swung his axe on his shoulder and rolled out the door, satisfied with the days work.\n\n\"I'm dead?\" Richard was mildly disappointed, he had been looking forward to the remaining 139 minutes of pooping at work this month.\n\n\"Looks like it.\" Death poked the corpse with the end of his scythe to make sure it wasn't one of those near Death experiences he'd been getting so many of lately. \"Yep, definitely dead.\"\n\n\"That sucks.\"\n\n\"Hmpf. You know, it would be nice if, just once, someone said 'Death? Oh wow, I've heard all about you, it's so nice to finally meet you!' instead of complaining about their own life. Or lack thereof.\"\n\n\"Sorry, that was... inconsiderate of me. I just have a lot on my mind right now.\" Richard apologized. It was his first time being dead, so it was a lot for him to take in. \"What was up with that guy, by the way? He just axed me to death for using a handicap toilet.\"\n\n\"Leonard? Yeah, he's been in a bit of a grumpy mood lately. Doesn't like it when people use his toilets.\" Death explained absentmindedly while reading on a clipboard.\n\n\"But there's like, three other empty handicap toilets right here!\" Richard pointed at the unoccupied booths next to theirs.\n\n\"It's a principle thing. Leonard just gets worked up about that kind of thing.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" Richard looked around for something to do, but couldn't find it so instead he resorted to asking, \"What now?\". Death glanced at his papers once more.\n\n\"You're going straight to hell, no purgatory for you. Using handicap toilets is a serious offense. I'll take you to the bus stop and someone will be along to pick you up shortly, you'll know them when you see them. Just hand this ticket to the driver and say 'One way to hell, please', they'll take good care of you. Are you ready to go?\" Death handed Richard a bus ticket and a pamphlet with the title 'Death and you: How to live after life'.\n\n\"Wait, does this mean I'll never see my friends or family again?\" Richard asked tentatively.\n\n\"Yes, I'm sorry for your loss and all that, it's all in the pamphlet.\" Richard did a silent, celebratory fist pump.\n\n\"Do you think you could get a message to them?\" Death sighed and pointed at the pamphlet.\n\n\"No communication from the afterlife is allowed. Again, it's all in the pamphlet.\"\n\n\"It's my name-day.\" Death hesitated for a moment. He always wished someone would remember his name-day, but of course, nobody knew his real name anymore and Death, unfortunately, wasn't a popular enough name to get one. Maybe if he got himself a twitter account more people would be aware of his daily struggle, Death thought to himself.\n\n\"Oh alright then, what's the message?\"\n\nFifteen minutes later, after having dropped off Richard and grabbed himself a coffee, Death knocked on the door to Richard's parents house. A man in his sixties opened the door.\n\n\"Do you mind if I come in? I'd rather not stand.\" Death sipped his coffee and the hot liquid dripped through his hollow ribcage and left a small puddle on the porch. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\"You're not one of them Jehovah's witness, are you?\" Richard's father squinted suspiciously at the man on his porch.\n\n\"Do I look like a Jehovah's witness?\" Death nodded at his black robes and wiggled his scythe a little.\n\n\"No, I guess not. Come on in then.\" Death stepped in to the cozy little home and a plump older woman in a flowery apron looked at him with a smile.\n\n\"I know you from somewhere.\" She said, peering at her new guest. \"Take a seat and let me guess.\" They sat down opposite each other and Richard's father joined them, still eyeing Death suspiciously.\n\n\"You are... that guy from that TV-show, aren't you? No wait, you're in that band! I just know I've seen you somewhere!\" Death's cheeks turned a slightly bonier white at the sudden attention.\n\n\"I'm Death.\" He said grinning stupidly and the woman let out a high pitched shriek.\n\n\"Oh my god! I've heard all about you and you're right here, in my house! That is so cool! Do you want anything? I could get you a refill on that coffee? Maybe a brownie? They're homemade!\" She immediately jumped out of her seat and hurried to the kitchen.\n\n\"No, thank you, Mrs. Miles, I'm good.\" She returned a moment later with a brownie, 'just incase you change your mind'.\n\n\"So, tell me everything. Are we all going to die?\" Giggled Mrs. Miles. \"Are we *already* dead?\" She whispered and gasped.\n\n\"No, actually, I'm here on a... personal visit. Your son asked me to-.\"\n\n\"It's his name-day today.\" Mrs. Miles interrupted. Her husband said nothing, but kept eyeing Death as if he thought he might try something funny.\n\n\"Yes, I know, you see I don't normally visit people until they are, you know... dead, but well, it's only your name-day once a year, right?\" Death said, but added 'not even once a year for some', bitterly. \"Anyway, your son asked me to give you a message, so here it goes, are you ready?\"\n\n\"Wait!\" Shrieked Mrs. Miles. She hurried out of the room and returned a minute later with a video camera. \"Alright, go!\" Death cleared his throat, making a rattling sound of bone against bone, and took out a piece of paper from the folds of his robes. He began reading in a slow, monotone voice.\n\n\"You were alright. I'll see you when I see you.\" Mrs. Miles looked on expectantly while the silence stretched on.\n\n\"Uhm... that's it.\"\n\n\"Oh, I just thought it'd be, I don't know...\" Mrs. Miles grabbed in the air aimlessly, as if expecting to find the right word there. \"... more interesting.\"\n\n\"Well, I'd best be off then. I'll see you next-, I mean at some point, maybe. Sorry for the anticlimactic ending, I guess.\" \n\n ",

Either myself, one of the other mods or another reader will give you a critique however small.\n\n**CRITIQUERS**: A critique should be a double pronged tool: Tell the writer what you liked (this is important!) and tell them what they could improve upon.\n\n**STORYTELLERS**: This gives your story more readers, but also opens you up to criticism, so be sure you can take it. Also, please correct all grammar/spelling/little nits beforehand. Expect to be mercilessly teased for all typos you miss, because that is fun. If you have done that important step the focus will be on the content itself. Though, if you don't do that, it is sometimes good to hear how to improve your grammar anyway. If you are searching for something specific in a critique, write what that is (example: \"Is the character of Jack believable? Did you understand What I was describing in the second paragraph?\") and then separate those out of story questions with a linebreak (on Reddit that would be a row of six dashes ------ on its own separated by a blank line.)\n\nAlso, please link to the prompt your response came from. It helps to know the context.\n\nI will be flitting in and out of this thread today and tomorrow, so have at it!",

It really calls into the question about the ethics and morality of god (if he/she/it exists at all).\n\n&gt;Either god is (a) not all-powerful, but cares about the world and its people, (b) is all-powerful but not all-loving, and therefore punishes or smites people as they see fit, (c) is all-powerful and all-loving but chooses to do nothing, which, in my mind, is morally reprehensible.\n\n&gt; Many people liken god's relationship with man as a way to allow mankind to mature and grow, giving us the freedom to do as we please and make our own decisions as a group in a similar manner to a parent giving their child more freedom and responsibility. The issue is that no human being (or humanity as a whole) benefits from many of the atrocities that have and are occurring. \n\n&gt; Even if we are able to look at the world differently because of events such as the Holocaust (to use an example) and examine human nature in a fundamentally different way, we must realize that an omnipotent deity allowed millions of people, whom he/she/it claims to love, to be tortured and systematically murdered for no good reason. Is that worth it? It is frankly, to me, and unsolvable question, one that questions morals and philosophy of everything.\n\nSo, imagine that you are an all-powerful being, ruling over Earth and its inhabitants. How do you rule, and why?\n\nThis prompt should inspire you to think philosophically about what an all-powerful beings true responsibilities are.",

            "selftext": "Did you know Africa has manatees? The Sirena Africanus. I saw a manatee once, when I went to Florida with Papa. This was a few years ago, when I was smaller, and the thing just glided up to the airboat we were sitting in and rammed his head right into the side. The man who took us out on a boat with a big fan on the back said they do that all the time, and since they don\u2019t have a big brain and they\u2019re fat it doesn\u2019t hurt them any. \n\nI remember Papa looking down at the animal floating around the boat and he tried to point out the scars along its back from where motorboats had cut their blades into it. I couldn\u2019t see the scars, they were obscured by the water. The manatee just looked like one big shadow banging his head into the boat. But it didn\u2019t seem to mind, maybe it got hit in the head too many times.\n\nI got a letter in the mail a few weeks ago. I was sitting in the living room watching The Price Is Right when the mail came. Jim, the mailman, always comes and slips it through the door around the time of the Showcase Showdown, so I have to wait until commercial to retrieve it. I\u2019ve always liked the word retrieve. We had a Golden Retriever once. After I retrieved the mail I sat back down on the couch and went through it. Most of it was bills and letters from the bank, which I set aside for Heidi because she takes care of those things. But then I came across a strange letter, one that had a rough outside paper and it looked like it had come a long way. I know it was a rough outside because I rubbed it against my face.\n\nIt was addressed to Papa, but since he\u2019s been gone for so long I took it in my room and hid it under the pillow. Since it was Tuesday, Heidi wouldn\u2019t help me clean my room for two more days, so I\u2019d have time to look over the letter.\n\nHeidi usually comes in the afternoon and to make sure I\u2019m doing okay. She\u2019s my helper that Papa set me up with before he went away. I don\u2019t like her. When she\u2019s mad at me she just stares at me and tap-tap-taps her foot with her arms crossed. She always says I misbehave but I don\u2019t think I do.\n\nDid you know that it is about 6,000 miles to Africa from St. Louis? I found that out in my Africa book. I bought the book when my neighbor, Mr. Daniels, was moving and had a garage sale. I bought the book with some money Papa gave me and Mr. Daniels gave me a ruler for free! There is a map on the inside cover and I used the ruler see how many miles it was across half the United States and to Africa, and it is just about 6,000 miles.\n\nPeople say Papa was a mousy man, or at least they say that when they think I can\u2019t hear, like when I pretend to be asleep and the grownups sit around the kitchen table on Papa\u2019s birthday. He wasn\u2019t mousy, but more like a bushbaby, with large eyes and a slim nose that rose up at the tip. I got the large eyes from him, but people say I have Mama\u2019s nose. \n\nPapa was the county coroner, which meant he took care of dead people so their families could get them back. One day, he was called out to Garrettsville, which to two towns away, to pick up a woman hit by a car. Since he was the coroner for the whole county, the sheriff in Garrettsville didn\u2019t know Papa, much less Mama. So Papa rolled up in his wagon and began to unload the body bag, when he saw a green shoe underneath the white sheet. The grownups say that\u2019s when he knew it was Mama.\n\nThat\u2019s usually how the story goes. Sometimes the women will gasp and the old men will give a grunt. Sometimes the story stops there, sometimes it goes on.\n\n\u201cCan you imagine,\u201d one will say, \u201cpullin\u2019 up and seeing that? And knowing you have to live the rest of your life with that rattlin\u2019 around in your head?\u201d\n\nA couple will agree.\n\n\u201cAnd knowing you have to raise that slow boy all by yourself,\u201d someone will say.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine,\u201d a woman will say. \u201cHe was never the same after that. He was always quiet, but he--he was just gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle he lasted as long as he did,\u201d one will say. \u201cAnd to provide for the boy as he did. So he could take care of himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat boy ain\u2019t never going to be able to care of himself,\u201d someone, likely one of the women, will say.\n\n\u201cTo Robert,\u201d one will say.\n\n\u201cTo Robert,\u201d the rest will say.\n\nThen I will hear the beer bottle clinking.\n\nDid you know that a cheetah can run 120 kilometres an hour? A leopard can only run 57 kilometres an hour, but I like them better. Leopards can climb trees and swim fast. Lions look cool, but they like to be in big families. I\u2019m like a leopard. When a leopard is two, the mother leaves and it is on its own.\n\nThe day Papa left he gave me three dollars and sent me over to Mr. Daniel\u2019s garage sale, where I bought my Africa book. It has a green cover with a drawing of a gold lion and was printed the year Mama and Papa got married: 1957.\n\nI was looking through Mr. Daniel\u2019s old records because I still had two dollars and fifty cents when someone shouted. I looked up to see another neighbor, Mrs. Clark, pointing behind me, back toward my house. I turned around to see grey puffs of smoke coming out of the garage. \n\n\u201cFire!\u201d someone yelled.\n\nI stood up and ran towards the house, but then I remembered I had forgotten my Africa book and turned back to retrieve it, right into the arms of Mr. Daniels who held me and wouldn\u2019t let me go.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a fire. Papa had taken the garden hose Mama used to water the Azaleas with and put one end into the back part of the wagon and one end in the window. He got in and turned on the engine.\n\nWhen the police and ambulances and firetrucks arrived it was too late to save Papa. Mr. Daniels and I stood in the driveway, his arms draped around my shoulders as the police looked at the car.\n\n\u201cIs there a note?\u201d the bald deputy said.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d the deputy with a hat said. \u201cStandard,\u201d \n\n\u201cWell, somebody better call the coroner,\u201d the bald deputy said.\n\n\u201cHey, dummy, he is the coroner,\u201d the deputy with the hat said.\n\n\u201cShit! Who the fuck\u2019s gonna be coroner now?\u201d \n\nThey both laughed.\n\nDid you know that the African Rock Python kills by asphyxiation? That\u2019s what Papa died of too.\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m going to Africa. Not because of the asphyxiation part, but about being alone part. There isn\u2019t anything for me to do here except watch the Price is Right and wait for Heidi to tap-tap-tap her foot at me. I want to see nature, like Papa and I did in Florida. \n\nAfter Heidi left the night I got the letter, I opened its rough envelope and read it.\n\n&gt;Hello,\n\n&gt;By the time you read this I will be dead. But there is time to save my family and to have back what is ours.\n\n&gt;My name is Abaeze Buhari and I am cousin to the King of Nigeria. I am asking and pleading with you in honesty and sincerity to assist my family. I am 3rd in line to the throne of Nigeria and the rebels are getting closer every day. To take steps as to a precaution, I have hidden $8,000,000 (eight million dollar) in an account in Switzerland for my family. Unfortunately, the rebels have frozen my bank account so I cannot be asking for the money until I pay the bank $20,000 (twenty thousand dollar).\n\n&gt;It is too late for me. The rebels will come and kill me. But you may be able to save my family. Please I beg of your help. You will be rewarded with $3,000,000 (three million dollar) for your help in just the time of two weeks.\n\n&gt;Please send bank account and routing number to this address.\n\n&gt;I beg of you.\n\n&gt;Your friend,\n\n&gt;Abaeze\n\nI knew where Heidi kept the bank stuff. She watched over the money Papa left me so I\u2019d be able to take care of myself in our old house. I sent the numbers to my friend Abaeze but I told him I didn\u2019t need the $3,000,000 (three million dollar), but I wanted to come to Africa and stay with the family I saved. I told him I wanted to go see the lions and elephants. I asked him if he knew where the African manatees lived.\n\nTwo weeks later, when Heidi came to see me on a Wednesday, she walked in the door and stopped. It must have given her quite a fright because she looked very pale. I was standing next to the coach with my suitcase, waiting to go to the airport.\n\n\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d she asked, crossing her arms.\n\n\u201cThe airport,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWhy are you going to the airport?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cTo Africa,\u201d I said.\n\nTap-tap-tap went her foot.\n",

Signups for next weeks round begin on Monday and end on Wednesday**\n\n**The first Match Thread is here http://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1kdprk/writer_vs_writer_match_thread/**\n\n\nI'd like to introduce you to Writer vs Writer.\n\n\nWriter vs Writer is a battle between 2 randomly drawn participating writers. Each has 96 hours to write the best short story (&lt;750 words) on a randomly assigned prompt. \n\n\nIt's a quick fun challenge for you to enjoy.\n\n\n **The 4 Rules**\n\n(1) Writers join up by leaving a **top level comment** to this post. You will then be randomly paired with another writer, and a prompt selected. The match post will be created and each of its top level comments will list a pairing and the chosen prompt. Entrants will then be informed the match has started and the match thread stickied to the front of the sub so it remains visible.  Submit your story as a reply to the prompt. Example:\n\n&gt; Unrelated_nick vs Double_Nick\n&gt;&gt;  **Prompt:  **\"We have to go now!\" by Stuffies12**    \nA nationwide evacuation is underway. Details as to why the mass relocation of\ncivilians into these designated 'safe zones' are still sketchy but hundreds of\npeople are pouring out of the streets moving as quickly as they can. You have a\ncouple of hours at most to sort out your things. Do you keep a level head or\nsubmit to the surrounding confusion?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Submit your story by replying to the prompt.\n\n\n(2) The winner of the battle is the person who receives the most votes from their fellow writers. Voting is public, you need to leave a comment to a story for a point to be awarded. Anyone may vote. The winner of a battle gets awarded 2 points, whilst points are shared equally in the event of a tie vote. We will have a few rounds and announce the overall winner at the end.\n\n\n(3) You have till 24:00 PST Wednesday  night to join up. Matches will be assigned at 24:00 PST on Wednesday  and you have till 24:00 PST on Sunday to reply. Voting is open after 48 hours and remains open till 24:00 PST next week Wednesday. \n\n\n\n(4) A month of Reddit Gold to the overall winner (total votes over the duration of the competition will be used as a tiebreaker in the event of 2 people with equal number of wins)\n\n\n**Have fun**\n\n*Note: After running the challenge last week I have made a few changes in structure to improve the running of the competition. The time to signup and to take part has been increased. Participants will be informed of the match thread being up in the Sign up Thread in the Sidebar of the Sub and once again the match thread will be stickied to the front of the sub. Points will be awarded for last week, and we will send out an updated post latervon this.*\n",

The idea is to get your reader to not figure out it was based on a children's story.\n\nFrom the original assignment:\n\nIn converting the children's story to an adult short story, here are some things you might try:\n\nChange the complexity of the language.\n\nChange a childish component (character, action, etc) into its adult \nequivalent, whatever you decide that to be. You'll want to get rid of talking trains and animals, for instance. Maybe that means changing a talking animal into a human character.\n\nAdd detail, description, characters that you wouldn't find in a children's story.\n\nCombine two characters into one character.\n\nCut parts from the story. Maybe the story has a satisfying ending and you want to leave the reader hanging.\n\nRearrange the order of the story.\n\nThrow a wrench in the story: something that would never occur in a children's story.\n",

I suppose every one else in the story could be secondary characters, but if you think up of a good antagonist feel free to incorporate them. \n\nThe assassin must encounter all of the culprits, there are seven of them. Five must die as a result of the assassins actions, what happens to the other two is up to you. \n\nThe assassin can have any type of personality you wish but at some point must exhibit the polar opposite of that personaliy for whatever reason for any length of the story. \n\nThe story takes place in a city during the winter. At some point some one must comment on the weather.\n\nFeel free to add the assassin and the employer meeting and discussing, or not. Also take the liberty of writing for all seven targets or just one, and piggy back on some one else's story. ",
