This will be posted bi-weekly, alternating with the Writing Workshops.\n\nThis is going to be quite like the Mod Q&amp;A, where you ask the questions, but only one mod answers them. You may ask any question you'd like towards a mod, whether it'd be about writing or about their favorite pizza topping. You can also prompt the mod if they're willing.\n\nIf there are any questions about these posts or the workshops, you can either PM /u/madlabs67, or message the moderators.\n\n---\n#Today's Featured Mod: /u/MNBrian\n\n\n**Would you like people to prompt you?**\n\nNot at the moment! :) \n\n\n\n**Favorite Genre To Write**\n\nTechno-thrillers, Sci-Fi, Magical Realism, Anything with real life but a twist. :D\n\n\n**Favorite pastime/hobbies**\n\nOh man! I like soooo many things. I write and read a fair amount. I love music and play guitar and sing (often with my wife). I love fishing and travel. I've seen the whole continental US, as well as most of Canada, parts of Central and South America but have not yet made my way to Europe/Asia and Australia. \n\n\n\n**Favorite Foods**\n\nIf you've seen Parks &amp; Recreation, I'm basically Ron Swanson's doppelganger in terms of food. Breakfast is the best meal ever created and I want breakfast for all meals all the time. \n\n\n**BONUS QUESTIONS**\n\n\n**When do you sleep?**\n\nNever. Basically. :) \n\nI work two jobs, one for a bank and one reading for a literary agent. I am going to school for my business degree because I should probably have one of those. I volunteer about 5 to 10 hours a week working with youth. And I love helping writers so I spend lots of time doing regular series posts here and elsewhere to help out. :)\n\n---\n---\n\n**Rules:**\n\n* Be respectful, and follow the rules of the subreddit. **No personal attacks. They will be removed without hesitation and without notice.**\n\n* A mod answer has the right to reveal as much as they feel comfortable.\n\n* Sometimes the mod doesn't have enough time to write a reply right away, so don't take it personally if they do not have the opportunity to reply right away.\n\n**Ask Away!!!**\n\n",

            "selftext": "Prompt: [You live in a utopian walled city. Until you saw what's outside of the wall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/673ugc/wp_you_live_in_a_utopian_walled_city_until_you/)\n\n---\n\nThe city of Communa was perfect.\n\nIts buildings were laid out in a perfect grid, with each one designed to be uniformly rectangular, standing equidistant from each other, and increasing in height from the shortest houses on the outer rim to the tallest tower in the center. Individually, each boxy and pastel-colored building appeared plain, but seen together, the structures created a spiral of colors that swirled toward the city's center building, which shone in brilliant white. The center building\u2019s striking lack of color and formidable height was matched only by the even taller wall which enclosed the city in a perfect circle, inside of which ran a wide, deep moat that was used for recreation and transportation along the outer rim.\n\nTo stand atop the white tower and view the city below was to look upon on of the largest and greatest wonders of the world; a perfect union between art, architecture, and city planning. True to Communa's reputation, anyone in the city was welcome to gaze upon its majesty, just as they were welcome to live a life of absolute freedom and luxury.\n\nFrom the outset, Communa was built with one ideal in mind; perfection. It was intended to be a bastion of hope for the rest of the world; free of crime, jealousy, complications, and suffering. Food, education, transportation, healthcare, and all the other basic necessities to life were unrestricted, easy to access, and of the highest quality; leaving individuals unshackled by necessity to instead focus their minds on higher goals that benefitted all of society. Art and technology prospered as like-minded Communians united to improve the quality of life at speeds and to new heights that prior generations could not even fathom.\n\nThe air was fresher. The water was cleaner. The food was more delicious. The celebrations were more plentiful.\n\nCommuna was a self-contained heaven on earth. So perfect was life in Communa that no citizen had any desire to leave.\n\nAt least, not until Cassia.\n\nLike the rest of the Communians, Cassia grew up on the outer rim of the city where the pastel buildings were shortest. In fact, her childhood home was on the outermost ring of the city on its west side - closest to the towering, curved white wall that separated the perfect city and the rest of the world.\n\nSometimes, on hot summer mornings, Cassia would sneak out of her house before the break of dawn and wade out into the crystal-clear water of the moat. There, she would swim out to touch the great barrier and look up to watch the brilliant light from the rising sun trickle down the wall to her like a waterfall of white-gold.\n\nLike most people of Communa, Cassia was naturally curious about the world around her. However, like all people of Communa, not once on any of these mornings, nor during any days when she and others would wade and play in the moat, did she even so much as wonder what might be on the other side of the gigantic and all-encompassing wall. It wasn't until she was a young woman, when she eventually moved out of her parents' house and into an apartment several blocks into the city and several stories up, that she had the first grain of this particular curiosity.\n\nIt was a morning like any other. She got out of bed, ate breakfast, and wandered over to the west-facing window where she watched the waterfall of light trickle down the great wall. As the sun found its way to street level, she beheld the wall in its entirety, and for the briefest of moments she had a feeling that there was something missing.\n\nAs soon as the feeling manifested, it was gone.\n\nCassia found over time that she was a lover of two things; children and the outdoors. She created a life for herself that combined those two loves in a way that both gave her a sense of belonging and contributed positively to society. Whereas teachers would educate the children indoors, Cassia instead loved to enrich their lives outdoors. Each day she would travel to a different park around the city, introduce herself to the parents, and then interact with the children as they played and learned about the perfect little world around them. She would teach them new games, tell them the history of the park, help them learn how to healthily settle disputes, and otherwise do her best to make sure the children of Communa took advantage of every last drop of the joy of the outdoors that they could take.\n\nEvery once in awhile, while doing her part to make the children\u2019s experiences in the parks a better place, Cassia might see an opportunity for improvement or simply have a spontaneous moment of creativity. After days or even weeks of thinking on it, she would develop an idea for something new she could add or something old she could change to make the parks in the city even more perfect than they already were. Once she felt confident in the idea, she would present it to the Communa Department of Leisure and Entertainment for consideration.\n\nOne such time, Cassia made her way to the Communa Department of Energy and Resources, which was just one of the many government branches operating in the white tower in the center of the city, to present an idea she had for a new and improved type of synthetic foliage for the city. The existing foliage that covered every synthetic bush and tree in the city was designed as part of the energy grid to absorb rays from the sun, convert it to electricity, and pass it down through the synthetic plant and into the city\u2019s underground generators. This development eventually led to the city completely doing away with all natural plants long before Cassia was born, replacing each tree, flower, and blade of grass with a synthetic variety capable of contributing to the city\u2019s energy needs while being scientifically-perfect in appearance and behavior. Cassia\u2019s new design, however, would be capable of doubling or even tripling the energy gathered by each synthetic plant in the city by capturing not only the energy from the sun, but that of the wind as well.\n\nAfter presenting her idea to a very enthusiastic group, Cassia felt too excited to simply go home, and so she decided to treat herself to the most beautiful view in the world by heading up to the top of the tall white tower. She gazed down upon the city as hundreds had before her. She took in all the sights from the pastel swirl of the rectangular buildings, to the parks that might soon be completely renovated to her recommendations, to the crystal clear moat in the distance that sat in the shadow of the great white wall where she used to spend so many dawns as a child.\n\nIt was then that the curious feeling came to her again; something was missing. As breathtakingly beautiful and perfect as Communa was, she got the feeling that it was lacking in something extraordinary.\n\nBeing a problem-solver by nature, Cassia latched onto this feeling and refused to let go. She stood still atop the tower as she thought long and hard about what it might be that she felt was missing, except she knew full-well that nothing was out of place, without purpose, or missing in Communa.\n\nAnd that, she realized, was exactly the reason.\n\nShe grasped onto the root of the feeling and held tight as she made her way back down in the tower to the Department of Movement and Places, where she was seated almost immediately with a representative to answer her now incredibly dire question.\n\nFor the first time, Cassia had a desire that she wasn't certain could be filled. The notion that something might be out of her grasp was completely new to Cassia, and somehow that made it all the more exciting for her. Somehow, that made it more real than anything she had ever known.\n\n\"What transport can take me out of Communa?\" she asked the young representative, who was neatly-dressed in a pastel blue shirt and pastel pink necktie, who took his seat in front of her.\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't understand,\" he said, then adjusted his necktie. \" Don\u2019t you have everything you could ever want or need here?\"\n\n\"Not anymore,\" she said. \"I now want to see what the world beyond the wall is like.\"\n\n\u201cBut why?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhat could the world out there have that you don\u2019t have here?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething\u2019s missing,\u201d Cassia said with a proud grin.\n\nThe man\u2019s face contorted into confusion, and in the moment that he would have typically given her a prompt and educated response, he instead politely excused himself from his seat and disappeared out his office door.\n\nCassia waited patiently, hands folded in her lap, as her heart beat heavy in her chest at the thought of experiencing a world where things were unknown, desired, and perhaps even out of reach. Try as hard as she could, Cassia couldn\u2019t imagine what that would be like, and the feeling of not knowing, itself, might have been enough to satisfy her curiosity were it not for growing up with the core knowledge that nothing would ever be kept from her.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the representative returned with a long polycarbonate tube held under his arm. He twisted off the top and pulled out a long blue rolled-up sheet, the likes of which Cassia had never seen before.\n\nAt that very moment, she knew that her new journey had already begun. Already, it was like the life she had known ten minutes ago was a long forgotten memory.\n\n\u201cThere is no transport out of Communa, but maybe we can find something in this copy of the original blueprints,\u201d the representative explained, uncurling the blue sheet so that it took up his entire desk space. \u201cI thought it might have something that our modern systems don\u2019t show.\u201d\n\nThe representative traced along the outer circle on the blueprint. Cassia leaned in to see it for herself; a sky view of her city, outside of which the blueprint showed nothing at all.\n\n\u201cWhat does it say?\u201d Cassia asked. She eagerly looked up at the man, whose own eyes shone bright with life and excitement like she\u2019d never seen in her life.\n\n\u201cA-ha!\u201d The representative proclaimed, stopping his index finger on a point on the blueprint and tapping it twice. \u201cThere\u2019s something under here.\u201d He traced the something with his finger across the blueprint, stopping in the center. \u201cIt looks like there\u2019s an emergency tunnel beneath us that leads out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do we get there? Where does it take you?\u201d Cassia asked hopefully.\n\n\u201cI think we just,\u201d the representative started to say, leaning in to look closely at the plans, but didn\u2019t finish. His eyes scanned the tunnel up and down, flipping the sheet around to look at it from different angles. Then he returned to the polycarbonate tube and peered inside as if he thought something might still be hidden there, but came back to the desk with nothing. He held his chin as he gazed down at the plans laid out on his desk once more, then, without a word, the representative for the Department of Movement and Places began to roll up the blueprints and put them back into the tube.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Cassia asked. \u201cWhere does it go? How do we get there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d the representative replied. \u201cFollow me.\u201d\n\nThe representative led Cassia out his door, past the lobby, and to the elevators. Once inside, he eyed the number panel suspiciously, looking for the right button to push to get where he meant to lead her. The numbers reached from 1 to 100, and beneath the first floor there were two rectangular buttons, one marked \u201cB1\u201d and the other marked \u201cB2,\u201d one of which Cassia assumed would lead to the underground tunnel. Neither of these seemed to satisfy the representative, however, and he briefly reached for the cap on the tube as if to take a second look at the blueprints inside, but then reconsidered.\n\nThe representative extended his index finger and slowly drew it toward the basement buttons. Hesitating for a moment before pressing either, he extended his middle finger and pressed both buttons simultaneously. At first only the lights outlining each button shone in yellow, but then a third hidden light below them illuminated to reveal a similar outlined rectangle with \u201cB3\u201d alight in the center.\n\nCassia grinned, and the representative smiled back at her.\n\n\u201cMy name is Cato,\u201d the representative said, extending his hand out toward Cassia.\n\n\u201cCassia,\u201d she responded, taking his hand and shaking it firmly in hers, understanding that Cato would be joining her for as far as this journey led.\n\nThe elevator descended three dozen floors without interruption, slowing slightly at the first floor and then easing past B1 and B2, before coming to a stop at the mysterious third basement. The doors opened, and although Cassia was uncertain what to expect on the other side, she was completely unprepared for what she did see. Outside of the elevator was a small rectangular room in which there was nothing but a few benches, barely lit and covered in dirt and dust from ages of stagnation. The air tasted foul on her tongue, and she immediately tried to cover her mouth with her arm as if that would shield her from the airborne debris and stale, unused air. Cato coughed hard into his arm, then covered his mouth with his shirt.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Cassia asked, slowly stepping out of the elevator and making the first print on the dusty ground in generations.\n\nCato followed closely behind, clutching onto the polycarbonate tube like it was a child\u2019s stuffed animal. \u201cI think it\u2019s the only way out,\u201d he said through his shirt.\n\nCassia coughed twice into her arm, then, taking cue from Cato, also used her shirt to act as a rudimentary air filter.\n\nAside from the few benches and the row of elevators along the wall, there was nothing in the large, dusty room. Cassia briefly considered turning back and heading home, only to have the elevator they\u2019d come down on close its doors behind her with a ding that echoed eerily through the cavernous space.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s it,\u201d Cassia said, squinting to make out a shape on the wall opposite the elevators. She pointed toward the shape, which appeared to be a pair of large, ornate half-circle doors. As the pair approached them and their eyes began to adjust to the low light, they found that the ornate design in the doors actually formed a aerial view of Communa, as if to remind them once more of the paradise they were leaving. Briefly, Cassia attempted to locate her childhood home, but due to the uniform design of the city and the doors\u2019 lack of color, its location eluded her.\n\nLooking at it from this perspective, for the first time in her life Cassia didn\u2019t think that Communa was all that beautiful after all.\n\n\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go,\u201d she said, grabbing the handle of one of the doors and giving it a pull.\n\nThe door didn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cHere, let me help,\u201d Cato said, taking grip of the same handle, counting to three, and then giving the large, old door a forceful pull in unison.\n\nWith a loud, low moan that resonated through the room, the door opened. Cassia and Cato exchanged gleeful smiles as they brought it open as far as it would go, then eagerly peered inside.\n\nA tunnel stretched before them for as far as the eye could see, with nothing but old, dim, dusty light fixtures every so often to guide their way. Cassia was the first to enter, and thus began their walk through the underground escape that measured the radius of the idyllic city above plus another seventy paces beyond.\n\nUpon reaching the end of the tunnel,Cassia and Cato ascended a stairway and came to one final large metal sliding door at the top that was slanted at a 45 degree angle. Together, they heaved the door open, exposing themselves to the blinding daylight that poured in and forcing them to cover their eyes as they adjusted to the brightness.\n\nIn a show of support, Cassia and Cato held hands. Together, they braved the final step out into the world that lay outside the great wall of Communa. There, they took a deep breath and lowered their hands from their brow to look around as their eyes adjusted to the light.\n\nThe air, though less stale than that in the tunnel, bore with it a mildly unpleasant odor. Though the landscape itself was flat in all directions, it was littered with the charred and rusted frames of thousands of vehicles from a world long gone. Interspersed around and between the junkyard of vehicles were scatterings of human bones with not the tiniest bit of flesh or cloth left to indicate who they once were.\n\nThe dirt below them was scorched and barren, and yet, having never seen real dirt inside the pristine man-made confines of Communa, Cassia found it beautiful. She fell to her knees and ran her fingers along each crack and rolled the dry brown residue between her index finger and thumb. It was then that the realization finally dawned on her that the outdoors that she loved so much, and the love for it that she shared with so many children, was false.\n\n\u201cWell would you look at that,\u201d Cato said behind her.\n\nGetting back on her feet and turning to see the tunnel from which they had emerged, Cassia saw the reason that none of these skeletons had made their way into the safety and comfort of the city; the outside of the large sliding door was a small part of a more elaborate disguise that made the emergency exit look like nothing more but a large boulder jutting out of the flat ground.\n\nBehind the false boulder, Cassia and Cato looked upon the outside of the great wall that they had both grown so used to seeing in every direction. While the wall separating Communa from the rest of the world may have been beautiful and white from the inside, on the outside, facing the sea of corpses, it was an ominous presence that towered over the land and bore markings from where hundreds, if not thousands, of the men and women who now lay scattered on the ground had tried in vain to break their way in.\n\nCassia climbed atop the nearest rusted and blackened vehicle frame to get a better view of whatever might lay beyond the graveyard. Squinting into the distance as the sun began to set, there appeared to be no end to the blistering and unmoving sea of metal and bone.\n\n\u201cWhat do you see?\u201d Cato asked from the ground.\n\n\u201cMore,\u201d Cassia said. \u201cSee for yourself.\u201d\n\nCato climbed up the steel to join her, put his hand above his brow, and peered off into the distance. \u201cWow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes on forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you ever imagine you\u2019d see something like this?\u201d Cassia asked.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even know it was possible,\u201d Cato replied, awestruck.\n\nCassia inhaled a deep breath of the foul-scented air and gazed out at the remnants of a desperate world long lost.\n\nA grin spread across her face.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see the rest.\u201d\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading, and I'd love to hear your feedback on this prompt!

Plasma can range in temperature from relatively cool to incredibly hot and dense to make up the core of a star.\n3. Stars are made up of very high temperature gas that creates plasma.\n\nPlease forgive me if I have a fact listed that turns out to not be true. These are just facts I looked up online to show the significance of plasma. Also, please do not feel like you have to stay within the realm of reality when it comes to plasma. This is a different universe to our own with possible different laws of nature. Happy writing!!",
