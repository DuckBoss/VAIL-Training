Next, some of their talented artists will bring what you wrote to life. If they don\u2019t feel particularly compelled by what you wrote they may not choose to draw your submission though, don\u2019t lose heart! It just means they felt more drawn to a different piece. \n\n**YOUR PROMPT**: Describe the most horrifying monster, animal, or creature that your mind can imagine. What does it look like? Where is it located? What does it do? Set the scene and describe your abomination to your heart\u2019s content. \n\n(Note: the /r/sketchdaily thread will be going up Monday so don't feel like you need to rush out your replies.)",

We are currently seeking submissions of no more than 200 words on a variety of topics.\n\nIn case you aren't a second language English speaker and therefore have never seen an ESL textbook, the four main areas of communication are listening, speaking, reading, and writing.  A huge obstacle for a textbook project is procuring the right to reproduce and distribute reading content.\n\nIf you have a story, a personal essay, a user manual, a feature story, or anything you would like to release under GPL (or other free license) as a part of our Open Source Textbook Project, please add it to [this google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eTOjm6GluYUQaTkcdNz6-U2rSyYB8Af8Wa3hs5lw5gc/edit), or e-mail it directly to me at tarkaan@gmail.com with source information and how you would like to be credited.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't pay anyone.  Ever.  This project is utterly without funding and we want to keep it that way, because funding always comes with strings.\n\nFor more information on the project, please check out [the project's website](https://sites.google.com/site/opensourcetextbookproject/).  There, you'll find links to the master plan, and more information about how you can contribute.\n\nTogether, we can normalize access to western media, services, NGOs, and governments for underrepresented groups who otherwise wouldn't have any access at all due to the language barrier.  This has the potential for being one of the largest humanitarian projects on Reddit.  \n\nCan you help?",

Do you feel it rambled on for too long?) and content (If you just read the first chapter would you continue on? Did the author describe things well?) are the two primary things I want you to focus on. As this is based on the fast and furious writing done during NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) - grammar and spelling errors can be forgiven as you shouldn't edit until you are finished with your entire book.

            "selftext": "PROLOGUE\n\nAugust 21st, 3112.\n\nSpace.\n\nFreeman looked at the camera screens. He selected the one on the starboard side. The view, the one he had come to enjoy, had been blocked by a behemoth. A black behemoth, poorly concealed by the immense lights of the dockyards. Electro-skin, emulating a twinkle of a star.\n\nA firefight raged outside it. Freeman sighed. Military men have too much time on their hands. They came once in a while, harassing and murdering anyone with an expired ID. Lucas yawned loudly, expressing his eagerness to join in the battle.\n\n\"Only spot left,\" West reiterated as he monitored the shields. Catherine ambled into the room, \"ETA?\"\n\n\"Official channels, three hours.\"\n\nA loud grumble pierced the room. Lucas rotated his chair and stood up. Stretching, he signaled West. West swiped at his holoscreen and everyone covered their ears as a screeching sound burst through.\n\nCatherine looked at West,\"Someone should fix th-\"\n\n\"Lucas,\" West retorted.\n\nFreeman looked back at the camera screen, swivelling the camera to look at the executions. Thirteen dead. This last bastion of 'freedom' was going south, a slow and painful death.\n\nHe noticed something on the edge on the screen, \"Shields, full power.\"\n\nThe screens went blank and Catherine and Lucas were upended.\n\n*******\n\n\"It is a simple matter. Hand over the cameras from your ship and we will let you go.\"\n\nFreeman adjusted the seats to a more comfortable position. He sipped the tea and glanced at the man. Tall, well built, government suit. Worry lines and even makeup. A wig. Tie hiding a wet spot, possibly from when Freeman accidentally dropped coffee on him on the way in.\n\nThe room was fully white, walls shining from the very bright light and shiny deluxe coating the Annual Corp Report bragged about. Multiple camera drones moved about, analysing Freeman and his movement. Automatic Threat Assessment, another proud chapter in the report. Thirty five million credits, completely useless on Freeman.\n\nA minute passed. The man started ready Freeman's file. He was trained to be patient. Play the waiting game. He could hold out much longer than any old smuggler.\n\nAn hour passed. Freeman was used to this. Hell, anyone making runs to and from Chrysalis was used to this. Random checks. Blackmail. Torture. \n\nThe Police Search Manual was available to anyone willing to pay. From the retired high ranking officers looking to supplement their lavish lifestyles restricted by an pension much smaller than the basic plus 'bonus' from when they had real power. Or from the low ranking officer looking to support their fledgling families and their fledgling alcohol addiction.\n\nThis time, it was slightly different. By now, the officer would have left. But the man's patience was clearly running out. If he hadn't been trained in keeping his cool, Freeman's head would be bleeding from getting smacked on the table too many times.\n\n\"I have no information.\" Freeman looked at the drones on his head. They could detect lies, brain patterns, inform the cop when the man of the other side of the law was sweating from guilt, anxious to get out.\n\n\"Your friends have given you up. You can-\"\n\n\"Am I free to go?\" Lies. Deceit. A man following the rules to the T vainly attempting to coax a confession from a man playing outside the rules.\n\n\"You-\"\n\nThe man was clearly under immense pressure. Nobody wanted to touch the destruction of ISU Black Thunder. An attack that audacious? Definitely an inside job. But he took it on, most likely because he was eager to please, having screwed up his last job. Any less desperate and he was a fool.\n\nFreeman stood up. The officer leaned back. The only question he could not lie to. Or ignore. Rules are rules, follow them.\n\nFreeman moved towards the door and a defeated voice trailed him, \"If you are not guilty, at least you can help us.\"\n\nThat's what Freeman wanted to hear. \"Fix my ship and you will have everything I know on MX-13.\"\n******\nCHAPTER 1: DUECE\n\nPART 1: INTERROGATION\n******\nFebruary 4th, 3115.\n\n\"Brace for impact!\"\n\nThird time in as many minutes, the ship rocked. Too many enemies. Too many missiles.\n\n\"Shields down to 41 percent!\"\n\nFreeman looked on, unperturbed by the proceedings. There was no point in even trying. Cornered dogs may be dangerous, but dogs cornered by a missile launcher? Inconsequential. \n\nUp top, Lucas was slowly losing consciousness, the small hole in the Turret room getting larger every second.\n\nAnother impact. Engines blew out. \"Shields! Power! Everything gone!\" What little emergency backup they had, had died three hours ago. Total darkness.\n\n\"Fucking hell!\" Catherine shouted. West looked in the general direction of Freeman, \"What now?\"\n\nSilence. \n\nA screech. Lucas fell down. \"Who automated the bloody ladders? Now, I'll have to go to the doctor.\"\n\nSilence. \n\n\"Uhm, aren't we supposed to be dead?\" Catherine pondered aloud. West wiped the sweat off his brow and began the slow and careful crawl to the engine room.\n\n\"No power, no oxygen,\" reminded Freeman. Lucas cursed again, \"Who automated the bloody air scrubbers? And didn't we have a flashlight?\"\n\nWest sighed. Lucas had broken it yesterday by smashing it over Rondo's head.\n\nSilence.\n\nThud. \"They're here. Stay calm.\" Lights began flashing. More noises. A smoke grenade made its entry first. Lights went off. The crew began coughing.\n\nFreeman made his way to the main door. A large man stood in front of him. He looked at Freeman and smashed his head with the baton.\n\n*******\n\nFreeman adjusted the seats to a more comfortable position. He sipped the tea and glanced at the man. Tall, well built, government suit. Worry lines and even makeup. A wig. Tie hiding a wet spot, possibly from when Freeman accidentally dropped coffee on him on the way in.\n\nHis head ached. But now was the last place he would show it.\n\n\"Intentionally trying to injure an officer. Another offence, hopefully the butterfly that breaks the camel.\"\n\n\"Officer, please obtain your proo-\"\n\nHe threw the file he was holding at Freeman. \"Proof.\"\n\nIn it was Freeman's old Cynary Bank account. He had no idea how they managed to get his record off the bank that promised full privacy. But still, he had been careful. No transfers more than what a supplier would receive under the InterGalactic Trade Federation Supply Union Act.\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"They were shut down yesterday after their leader was caught smuggling. You should be careful in choosing your ban-\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\nThe officer looked at Freeman. \"I nearly lost my job the last time. Still paying off the two hundred thousand credits.\"\n\n\"I promised you all I know about the MX-13. And I gave you all. If all is nothing, then there is nothing I can do about that.\"\n\nThe officer held his cup of tea more tightly. \"Well, they say, karma bites you back. Let's see how you get off this time. Let me-\"\n\n\"I wish to call someone.\"\n\n\"That privilege is only for people with minor crimes.\"\n\n\"My choice of bank is proof of nothing. Now, phone call or lawyer?\"",

            "selftext": "The idea for the prompt came from my inability to sleep last night, but I can totally see why someone would connect that creepypasta to this idea. \n\nNot being able to sleep is a scary thing. As kids you try to stay up as late as you can, you know? You get older and you start to sleep more -- you yearn for a nap here and there because the days just drag on. The idea came from what would happen if that yearning feeling just never went away? What if, one day, you just couldn't fall asleep?\n\n[A recently published article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/brains-flush-toxic-waste-in-sleep-including-alzheimers-linked-protein-study-of-mice-finds/2013/10/19/9af49e40-377a-11e3-8a0e-4e2cf80831fc_story.html) said that sleeping lets your brain drain the waste and might help combat alzheimer's, so what happens when that drain gets clogged after not being able to sleep? Do you start to forget who you are? Who your friends are? Do you start to hallucinate and become unable to tell the difference between real and imaginary? What happens when your nightmares crawl out of your mind and into the real world?\n\nIt's a scary thing. I've read about too little sleep contributing to early death, so what happens when you get no sleep for too long? What are the impacts?",
