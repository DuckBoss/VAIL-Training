This is when a limitation (or forced useage) of a word, letter, etc. is put on the writer. You should, however, give the prompt more direction than just the constraint.\n\nHere is a wonderful wikipedia article on the subject: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing\n\nNow your first official constrained writing prompt: The Reverse Alphabet Game. We had fun the last time with the alphabet game and most people went with the normal direction of the alphabet. This time, start with \"Z\" and work backwards. I will paste my explanation of how to do the alphabet game:\n\n**THE PROMPT**\n\nOne of the exercises we used to do in improv class was called \"The Alphabet Game.\" That's where you start a sentence beginning with the letter Z. Then the next sentence begins with the letter Y, the next X... and so on. So, today's prompt requires you to, essentially, do the alphabet - but I'll go a little easy on you and say that it can be in any form you want: A poem, short story, whatever. It could even be a single sentence as long as each word that follows the previous word is the next letter in the alphabet.\n\nFor your ease of reference, here is the alphabet in reverse:\n\n###Z Y X W V U T S R Q P O N M L K J I H G F E D C B A",

            "selftext": "I preface the post with these images, from the back covers of the first few issues of Fantastic Adventures: http://imgur.com/a/OEKx5\n\n**PREVIOUS ASSIGNMENTS**\n\nCurrently there is only one previous assignment, entitled Watson's Story and can be found by [clicking here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1bwyoe/modpost_watsons_story_the_first_lesson_in/)\n\nAs with the previous assignment, this is to be completed in your own time and you only need share your story if you feel it needs sharing. Otherwise, workshop it in your own time, improve it, keep it for future use. If you DO decide to post it, make it its own post and label it with the [PI] tag.\n\n**ASSIGNMENT**\n\nPulp novels and magazines were all the rage in the early 1900's. The pulps birthed many a famous character: Conan the Barbarian, Doc Savage, Flash Gordon, Fu Manchu, Hopalong Cassidy, Zorro, Tarzan... the list goes on. In fact, you can [read more about pulp fiction in this wikipedia article.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_magazine)\n\nSo we get to the nuts and bolts of the assignment with the prompt, you have two choices: Write a heroic tale. Your main character must overcome a gigantic obstacle. This takes place on another planet. Your world, your rules. You don't need to be too true to actual science, as you are writing in the mindset of what people knew of outerspace in the early 1900's. **OR** go to [this pulp science fiction title generator](http://thrilling-tales.webomator.com/derange-o-lab/title-o-tron.shtml) and generate a title for your story and write a story revolving around that title.\n\n**LESSON MATERIALS**\n\nNow here comes the fun part. I've collected, over the past few weeks, a massive amount of the, quite extinct, magazine \"**Fantastic Adventures**\" - and, they fall under public domain since the copyright registration has long since lapsed. Not only that, but its sister magazine Amazing Stories is readily available through web.archive.org. As well as a host of other quite enjoyable pulp magazines.\n\nThe idea is for your to steep yourself in the worlds presented by various authors. With the collection of Fantastic Adventures, I am giving them to you in CBR format. This is a \"comic book\" file format. You can read it with comic book viewers across all platforms. I particularly like ComicFlow for the ipad.\n\n*BOOKS/MAGAZINES*:\n\n- [FANTASTIC ADVENTURES Volumes 1-4](http://dropcanvas.com/6hnam) - Once extracted, these two zip files contain 30 issues from the beginning of Fantastic Adventures run. That's close to 4GB of reading. This is hosted on dropcanvas (which is run by a Redditor. If you create an account, you won't be put in a waiting queue.) If you enjoy these and want more issues, I have about 10GB more of them, PM me.\n- [AMAZING STORIES and other pulp magazines](http://archive.org/search.php?query=amazing%20stories%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts%20AND%20subject%3A%22pulp%20magazine%22) - archive.org is a wonderful place to grab stuff like this. In fact [click here](http://archive.org/search.php?query=mediatype%3Atexts%20AND%20subject%3A%22pulps%22) to see all the pulps they have to offer. What's great is that you can download in most file formats. Click \"All files: HTTPS\" to see every single file format they offer.\n- [Comic Book Plus](http://comicbookplus.com/?cid=1555) is another great resource with tons of public domain pulp novels and comic books.\n\n*ARTICLES ON THE SUBJECT*\n\n- [Pulp Magazines wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulp_magazine)\n- [Different categories on wiki related to pulps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Pulp_fiction)\n\n*RELEVANT SUBREDDITS*\n\n- /r/scifiwriting\n- /r/scifi \n- /r/sciencefiction\n\n*ADDITIONAL LINKS*\n\nThis weeks additional links are all comic book reader links for different platforms:\n\n- WINDOWS: http://www.cbrreader.com/\n- MAC: http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/21987/simple-comic\n- *nix: http://comix.sourceforge.net/\n- iOS Devices: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/comicflow/id409290355?mt=8\n- Android Devices: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.androidcomics.acv&amp;hl=en\n\n\nIf you have anything to add, please leave a comment.
