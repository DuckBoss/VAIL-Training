            "selftext": "^Welcome ^to ^Get ^to ^Know ^a ^Mod! \n-\nWelcome to the Wednesday post. This will be posted **twice a month**, alternating with the Writing Workshops.\n\nThis is going to be quite like the Mod Q&amp;amp;A, where you ask the questions, but only one mod answers them. You may ask any question you'd like towards a mod, whether it'd be about writing or about their favorite pizza topping. You can also prompt the mod if they're willing.\n\nIf there are any questions about these posts or the workshops, you can either PM /u/Arch15, or message the moderators. \n\nToday's Featured Mod: Nightingale115!\n-\n**Prompts:** **Yes**\n\n* Favorite Genre to write?\n\nA tie between fantasy and sci-fi.\n\n* Favorite Pastime?\n\nNature Photography.\n\n* Favorite food    \n\nSteamed Clams and fried oysters.\n    \n***\n**Rules:**\n\n* Be respectful, and follow the rules of the subreddit. **No personal attacks. They will be removed without hesitation and without notice.** \n* The mod answer has the right to reveal as much as they feel comfortable. \n* Sometimes the mod doesn't have enough time to write a reply right away, so don't take it personally if they do not have the opportunity to reply right away.\n\n\n**Ask away!**",

You can choose to stay as you are, mortal and fertile.\n\nIf a human is infertile for whatever reason, taking the second option will grant them fertility.  \n\nIf the human is already a mother or father and they choose the first option then their offspring , and everyone down the line in the family tree, will vanish.

They will always regenerate.\n\nThe mad scientist is fully capable of and will carry out each human's decision.

            "selftext": "\"You wound me, Siegebreaker,\" the harpy said.\n\n\"Woman, I haven't even touched you,\" I said.\n\n\"You know what I mean. You still don't trust me.\"\n\nI turned in the saddle. \"Ruksana, we're professionals. Were our positions reversed, would you trust *me?*\"\n\n\"... I'll give you that one.\"\n\nWe rode on, past farms and little villages. We were a good-sized force now, which meant we didn't see many peasants. We did see suspicious movement in the fields, as well as dropped tools and overturned cabbage carts.\n\nIt's always like this when you travel with a body of troops. If you want to ask directions you have to look in the nearest ditch.\n\n\"Okay, so why are you coming along with me?\" Ruksana asked. \"Do you still think it's a trap? Why would I set it across the great desert?\"\n\n\"Maybe it's a big trap,\" I said. \"Maybe you've got an army there. Or *maybe* you're trying to lure me beyond Yscyigg's influence.\"\n\n\"What convinced you that it isn't a trap?\"\n\n\"Yscyigg showed me,\" I said. \"I saw the temple. It's real enough.\" \n\nShe cocked her head. \"Interesting relationship you have with your god. He knows you want to kill him and he points you toward a means to do it.\"\n\n\"I don't know that I want to kill Yscyigg,\" I said. \"I just want a few words, is all.\"\n\n\"And after?\"\n\n\"... I'll give you that one.\"\n\nWe ambled on. The landscape crawled by. Long-distance riding isn't that much faster than a brisk walk on foot. A mixed party like ours was lucky to make thirty miles a day. The advantage to riding was all the extra gear you could bring. Plus you had horses if you needed to fight or run.\n\n\"I understand your reluctance to ally with me,\" Ruksana said. \"You must see a monster when you look at me.\"\n\nShe looked at me over the curve of one shoulder. Her eyes were luminous, even through the veil. \n\n\"I spent much of my life killing your kind,\" I said.\n\n\"We're not all bad.\"\n\n\"Maybe. But some of you needed killing. Have you seen how much damage a blood cult can do?\" \n\nI still had nightmares.\n\nShe pursed her lips. \"The actions of a few cannot be taken to represent Lilit-worshippers as a whole. Nobody's very civilized when they're being hunted.\"\n\n\"And what's Lilit-worship like when it's at home?\"\n\n\"Glorious.\"\n\nLong ago, when the gods were at peace, the harpies had a kingdom. There were temples and cities and great stone aviaries.\n\n\"Six times a year the peasants gave blood to the priesthood. Six more times the priesthood gave blood to my sisters.\"\n\n\"And nobody died?\"\n\n\"Nobody,\" Ruksana said. \"Nobody got too dizzy either, the day after the blood tribute was traditionally a holiday.\"\n\n\"What did you do with all that blood?\" \n\n\"My sisters drew strength from the people. They used that strength to benefit the people. It's the same as what you Yscyigg-worshippers do. One way or another, the gods get what belongs to them.\"\n\n* * * \n\nRuksana kept glancing at Eirik all the next day, much the way a cat observes a caged bird. \n\n* * * \n\n\"Hello,\" Ruksana said.\n\n\"Ma'am,\" Eirik said. \n\nThey'd stopped while there was still enough light to get settled. The campsite was a well-used one, it wasn't difficult to figure out where the horses should go.\n\n\"Enjoying your apprenticeship?\" Ruksana asked.\n\n\"It has its moments,\" Eirik said. \"This isn't one of them.\"\n\nGrani nickered. It was a low neigh, but to Eirik's ears it sounded like laughter. \n\n\"Seven riding horses and half as many packhorses and mules,\" Ruksana said. \"Quite a responsibility you have here.\"\n\n\"I was surprised I still had it after you joined up.\"\n\nRuksana grinned. She'd removed her veil. \"Don't feel bad. My boys have more combat experience. Of course they're excused from groom duty.\"\n\n\"Hmph. Are you here to make me feel bad?\"\n\n\"No, I'll help. Hand me that curry brush.\"\n\nThe riders had already walked their horses to cool them down. Each rider had loosened the saddle girth, then removed the saddle and bridle. They left the more involved work of picketing and grooming to Eirik.\n\nThe boy looked for saddle sores. He ran his hands down the animals' legs, feeling for bumps and cuts. He picked their hooves then watched how the horses walked on them. \n\n\"I don't eat until they've eaten and I don't drink until I've found them water,\" Eirik said. \"Abelard even has me checking their pasture for fallen apples. Apples!\"\n\n\"That's just common sense,\" Ruksana said. \"And colic is something you want to avoid.\"\n\n\"Hmph.\"\n\n\"Don't you think Abelard gave you this responsibility for a reason?\" she asked.\n\nEirik look at her. \"I think this is the sort of scut-work that masters have given their apprentices since before the gods existed.\"\n\n\"Ah, but you can't be certain. You won't know the difference between a chore and a lesson until you have apprentices of your own.\"\n\nEirik almost threw up his hands, but as gentle as these horses were, they were still half-ton animals -- and easily spooked. \n\nRuksana smiled. \"You're learning already. I never met a groom that didn't know how to be gentle and deliberate.\"\n\nThere was the smell of pipe smoke. \n\n\"You're reading too much into this,\" Abelard said. \"If there's a lesson, it's that no one should be an apprentice forever.\"\n\nHe took a sip on his pipe. \"That is, unless you like shovelling shit.\"\n\n* * * \n\nNow the harpy was looking to El Gato, one predator sizing up another. El Gato was aware of this -- you could tell from the way his ears perked up. There was no malice in Ruksana's gaze, however, so I said nothing.\n\n* * *\n\n\"Hello,\" Ruksana said.\n\n*\"Gah!\"* El Gato said, and fell off the branch.\n\n\"Whoops. Hang in there!\"\n\nUsing just her hands, Ruksana lowered herself onto the cat-man's branch. She grabbed a handhold with one hand and his jacket with the other. El Gato scrabbled back to safety.\n\n\"How did you manage to sneak up on El Gato?\" \n\n\"I flew high, cut the engine, and glided in on my wings,\" Ruksana said. \"I can be very quiet that way.\"\n\nWith her lower half gone and her wings folded the harpy was surprisingly small.\n\n\"Did you want something?\" El Gato asked. \"Because this one was hoping for some privacy.\"\n\n\"I figured. What with you climbing a tree.\"\n\n\"Yes, well, El Gato was trying to get some work done...\" He looked around. \"... and it seems that he has dropped that work.\"\n\n\"I'll get one of my boys to pick it up.\" Ruksana put a hand to her mouth and whistled.\n\n\"No, wait--\"\n\nLady, Bailey, and Canelo ran up, swords in hand. \n\n\"It's all right,\" Ruksana said. \"We just dropped a few things.\"\n\n\"Finding, finding!\" Bailey said. The dogmen scanned the ground.\n\n\"No, do not--\" El Gato dropped down and landed on all fours.\n\n\"Wow,\" Bailey said, holding up the jewels.\n\n\"Wow,\" Canelo said.\n\n\"Wow,\" Lady said. \"Such shiny.\"\n\n\"Give that back!\" The cat-man grabbed the bag. \"And that too!\" He leaped back into the branches.\n\n\"You've been sewing gems into your clothes?\" Ruksana asked. \n\nEl Gato sighed. \"Everyone's clothes. As well as anywhere else that could hide pockets. Where else is El Gato supposed to hide treasure?\"\n\n\"You could bury it.\"\n\nThe cat-man laughed. \"And enrich future generations? El Gato would rather keep his wealth close by.\"\n\n\"And not just El Gato's wealth,\" he said. \"When the time comes, Abelard will be pleased to see his share.\"\n\n\"The paladin doesn't seem like a man who cares about money,\" Ruksana said.\n\n\"That is true.\" El Gato gave a low laugh. \"He always has coins for the beggars. Even the ones who are clearly just doing it for a day job.\"\n\n\"What about the others?\"\n\n\"The centaur and the rich boy have never known hunger. El Gato, meanwhile, can call it by its first name.\"\n\n\"So you follow the paladin because he pays well?\"\n\nEl Gato showed his teeth. \"What other reasons does El Gato need?\"\n\n* * * \n\n\"I know what you're doing,\" I said. \n\n\"And that would be?\" Ruksana asked. \n\n\"You're talking to each of my people.\"\n\n\"And what's wrong with that?\" she said. She crossed her arms and toppled forward. \n\nIt's not easy keeping your dignity when you've lost your legs.\n\n\"Looking for something?\" I asked. \"You seem to be having trouble getting around.\"\n\n\"I'm perfectly fine,\" she said, and resumed walking on her hands. \n\nI put my hands on my hips. \"Can't you fly?\"\n\nShe grit her teeth. \"Only for about five minutes. And flying makes me *hungry.* You wouldn't like me when I'm hungry.\"\n\n\"Right.\"\n\n\"Okay, where are my legs?\" \n\n\"Shapely pair like that, you ought to keep better track of them. \"\n\nShe flared her wings. *\"What did you do?\"*\n\n\"Nothing,\" I said. \"I woke up and they were in my tent. So I trapped them under the blankets. \"\n\n\"Oh,\" she said. \"They wander sometimes.\"\n\n\"They were sitting on my face.\"\n\n* * * \n\nPredictably, Ruksana spent all next day observing Mona. I really couldn't fault her for this. I'd been doing the same to her and her people. In our business you don't spend time with anyone without figuring out how to take them down. If the worst should happen, at least you'll know who to kill first. \n\n* * * \n\n\"Hey there,\" Ruksana said. \"I found your sewing kit.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Mona said. \"Please set them down over there.\"\n\nThe cooking fire licked at the stewpot, which hung from a tripod of fresh-cut branches. \n\n\"Smells good,\" Ruksana said. \"Spicy.\" She stepped around the centaur and sat on a log.\n\nMona nodded. \"I'm glad we could persuade you to raid the castle's stores.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't do us much good if we left them,\" Ruksana said. \"Anyway, Eirik wanted the sugar.\"\n\nMona shook her head. \"That boy and his sweet tooth... but I see you found your lower half.\"\n\nRuksana crossed her legs. Her trousers were baggy at the hips, tight at the calves. \"Never leave home without them.\"\n\n\"Most people don't,\" Mona said.\n\n\"Speaking of home, you are a long way from yours. You don't see many centaurs this side of the Silk Road.\"\n\nMona put down her ladle. \"But you *do* see them.\"\n\n\"I don't often see them working as camp followers.\" Ruksana lowered her voice. \"You're not here against your will, are you?\"\n\n\"Goodness, no!\" Mona laughed. \"As strong as he is now, Abelard could never catch me. What more when he was injured?\"\n\nShe looked down. \"He was got so terribly hurt rescuing me. For days he could barely walk. How could I leave him?\"\n\n\"I see,\" Ruksana said. She thought about nurses and their patients. \n\n\"Anyway, being a camp follower. What's that feel like?\"\n\n\"It feels... useful,\" Mona said. She stirred the pot. \"Like I'm doing something with my life.\"\n\n\"What were you doing before this?\"\n\n\"You're not as subtle as you think you are,\" Mona said. \"I was wondering when you'd get to me.\"\n\nThe harpy shrugged. Her wings shifted. \"We'll probably see mortal danger before this journey is over. I want us to trust each other.\"\n\n\"It would help if you answered as many questions as you asked.\"\n\n\"Okay. What do you want to know?\"\n\nMona pawed the ground. \"I... actually don't have any questions.\"\n\n\"I can assure you, everything I've said so far has been true. And I don't plan to lie.\"\n\n\"What about your god?\"\n\n\"Unlike some, Lilit is very clear on what she wants. *Go to the temple. Secure the knowledge.* Nothing about betraying anyone.\"\n\n\"Oh, good,\" Mona said. \"I was getting used to having you around.\"\n\nThe men were walking up, bowls in hand.\n\n* * * \n\nLilit's champion would be the most dangerous, of course. Canelo was the oldest of the dogmen and had a few facial scars. Lady had the wide-awake look of a born survivor. Bailey, meanwhile, was an overgrown puppy. I considered him the least dangerous. That didn't meant he was harmless. Nobody's harmless. And people can surprise you. \n\n* * * \n\n\"Abelard! *Abelard!\"*\n\nI was awake. Eirik didn't scare easily. I came out of my tent with a drawn sword and a bad mood. My armour was on, what there was of it. Soldiers don't get old without learning to sleep in harness.\n\n\"Eirik?\" I said. \"Where are you?\"\n\nIt was dark. It was raining. I could barely see the boy as he ran toward me with a bundle in his hands.\n\n\"She's right behind me,\" Eirik said. \"The harpy!\"\n\n\"To arms!\" I said. \"TO ARMS.\"\n\nEl Gato popped out of his tent with a drawn knife. Good man. Mona came out of hers with the spare longswords in either hand. She couldn't use them, but a dual-wielding centaur is scary. I got between Eirik and his pursuers.\n\nRuksana ran toward us. I got my sword up and she stopped before it could go through her eye.\n\n\"Siegebreaker,\" she said. \"This isn't what this looks like.\"\n\nThe dogmen ran up behind her. They hadn't drawn their swords yet, but that could change.\n\nI gestured and a black tentacle punched out of the ground where a tree had been. It wrapped around the trunk and swung the tree into the ground, shaking the branches off. Then it lifted over our heads, a gigantic club.\n\n\"Please tell me what this looks like,\" I told Ruksana. \"Because it looks like you attacked my man. Eirik, are you all right?\"\n\n\"I'm fine, sir,\" Eirik said.\n\n\"Then by Yscyigg's tits, *what's going on?!*\"\n\n\"You remember... you remember the farm we passed?\"\n\n\"Yes?\" I said. \n\nWe'd considered stopping there for the night. Most farmers are glad for the company and the chance to make a few coins. But this family didn't seem to want guests. The farmer and his wife didn't meet anyone's eyes.\n\n\"You remember the farmer's daughter?\" Eirik asked.\n\n\"The pregnant one?\" I asked. Lilit had exchanged a few words with her. \n\n\"Well, she isn't pregnant anymore.\"\n\nThen I heard it. Over the sound of the rain. A baby was crying.\n\nEirik held the newborn close. He brandished his sword in his other hand. A clumsy way to use a long blade, but Eirik was willing.\n\nI turned to Ruksana. \"What. Happened. To. The mother?\"\n\n\"She'll be fine,\" the harpy said. \"I'm a trained midwife. The birth was easy.\"\n\n\"Ruksana was gonna eat the baby!\" Eirik said. \"I saw her!\"\n\nThe harpy grit her teeth. \"I was doing my job. My sacred duty as a servant of Lilit.\"\n\n\"This is not an act of desperation,\" I said. \"You've done this many times.\"\n\nShe was shaking. \"This is what I was made for. To cull the old, the sick. The unwanted and alone. Don't you understand? *I need to do this.*\"\n\nShe looked to Mona. \"I'm sorry, dear, but a harpy can't live on stew alone.\"\n\n\"Monster!\" Mona said.\n\n\"I saw them leave camp,\" Eirik said. \"I saw them take the baby. And when I saw what she was about to do I... I grabbed the baby.\"\n\nThe rain was cold. We were all soaking in our clothes. The bundle wailed into the pouring night.\n\n\"The wilderness is full of abandoned infants,\" Ruksana said. \"Old wells everywhere are full of little bones.\" She drew her lips back over her fangs. \"My way is the merciful way.\"\n\n\"Abelard...\" Eirik said.\n\nRuksana reached out to him. \"Give me the child. I shall send it to Lilit, and She shall cherish it for ever.\"\n\nThe tentacle dropped the tree between us. We all jumped back.\n\n\"Give me the baby!\" Ruksana said. \"Its mother doesn't want it. Its *father* doesn't want it. There is no one in the world that will claim it!\"\n\n\"I would,\" Eirik said. \"I mean, I claim it.\"\n\nI turned to him. \"You'd do that?\"\n\n\"I...\"\n\n\"You'd take responsibility for it?\" I asked.\n\n\"... with your permission?\"\n\n\"You don't need my permission.\"\n\n\"Then I take responsibility,\" he said. \"I claim this child.\"\n\nI lowered my sword. \"Then it is done.\"\n\n\"And *you,*\" I said, pointing to Ruksana. \"We are going to have words. Once this mission is over, we are going to have words indeed.\"\n\nShe glared at me, but said nothing.\n\nEirik lowered his sword. \"Uh... sir? What do I do now?\"\n\n\"Isn't it obvious? It's a baby!\"\n\n\"Here,\" Mona said. She took the bundle from him and brought it to her chest. She lifted her shirt and offered a nipple.\n\n\"The milk will flow soon,\" she said. \"Now let's all get somewhere nice and dry.\"\n\n* * * \n\nNobody got much sleep that night.\n\n* * *\n\n\"Did you know that centaurs can do that?\" El Gato asked.\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" I said. \"Why do you think I'd know?\"\n\n\"No reason.\"\n\n* * * \n\n[**Chapter 1**] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/34yua0/wp_what_doesnt_kill_me_has_made_a_tactical_error/cqzl6y8)\n\n[**Chapter 20**] (https://redd.it/3p56as)\n\n[**Chapter 22**] (https://redd.it/3s26pf)",

In the 1940s and 1950s he was noted for his campaigns against [McCarthyism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism) and other abuses of government power.\n\n-----\n\n**What To Post**\n\n**Leave a story if you have something to share. If you do post, please make sure to leave a comment on someone else's story. Everyone enjoys feedback!**\n\nAs usual, feel free to post anything and everything writing related. Prompt responses, personal work, whatever you can think of is all welcome. Please use good judgement when posting anything that could be considered NSFW (erotica, not violence or cussin'), and if it's wildly so, use a [PI] or an external link instead of posting the whole text.\n\nMake sure you take the time to read the goldmine of writing that comes from this thread and offer critique or compliments.\n\n\n-----\n\n\n**How To Post**\n\nReply! External links are fine, www.chapterfy.com is just one example of a good place to externally host longer stories for free. If you want criticism, ask for it! Feel free to promote your book and story shamelessly here, though we would appreciate a quick synopsis of that 60k word novel that you're working on.\n\n-----\n\n**A Final Word**\n\nIf you haven't dropped by /r/bestofWritingPrompts yet, please do! We try to showcase the very best the subreddit has to offer. If you see a story you think rises above the rest, please consider adding it there!",
