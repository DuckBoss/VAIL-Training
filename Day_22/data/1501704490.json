Welcome to the Wednesday Wildcard!**\n\nIt's the fifth Wednesday of the month, so that means it's time for a bonus post.\n\nBefore we begin, we must all welcome our new non-automated moderators to the team:\n\n* /u/Illseraec\n* /u/hpcisco7965\n* /u/Graphospasms \n* /u/Samjez\n* /u/nickofnight\n\nSure, Automoderator and I do all the [nitty-gritty work](http://i.imgur.com/IaUiMhC.gifv) around here, but there's something to be said about [manual labor](http://i.imgur.com/AFiz1AZ.gifv) which helps this place run smoothly too.\n\nYou may ask any question you'd like towards one, multiple, or all mods (and not just the new ones), whether it'd be about writing or about their favorite pizza topping. You can also prompt the ModSquad (although they may only respond as their schedules allow).\n\nSo proceed with the asking.\n\n###RULES\n\n* If you have a direct question for a specific mod, be sure to include their username as this will ensure they don't miss it. e.g. /u/err_ok\n* Be respectful, and follow the rules of the subreddit. No personal attacks, and they will be removed without hesitation.\n* Mods have the right to reveal as much as they feel comfortable.\n* Sometimes the mod doesn't have enough time to write a story, so don't take it personally if they do not have the opportunity to reply.\n* Bonus points if your question is written as a story\n\n---\n\n[**First Mod AUA**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/39ks0r/ot_we_are_the_mods_ask_us_anything/) \u2022 [**Second Mod AUA**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/39ks0r/ot_we_are_the_mods_ask_us_anything/) \u2022 [**Third Mod AUA**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/53t57x/ot_we_are_the_mods_ask_us_anything/) \u2022 [**Fourth Mod AUA**](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/53t57x/ot_we_are_the_mods_ask_us_anything/)\n\n---\n\n###FLASH FICTION CHALLENGE - WINNERS\n\nThis month's Flash Fiction Challenge (our second!) required stories that were set near/on/under/over the sea and involved an old sofa. Jeez Louise, we got a lot of great stories (50!) about sofas&amp;mdash;most of them floating! (Do sofas even float? Has anyone done that research?) Our eminent judges have awarded wins in a variety of sensible and not-so-sensible categories. Winners get bragging rights and a smug sense of superiority. Without further ado, here are the winners chosen by /u/hpcisco7965 and /u/you-are-lovely (mainly hpcisco7965 this time, so direct all complaints to him):\n\n* Best Overall Story: /u/StabbyKaji ([story](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6vghpi/cw_flash_fiction_challenge_location_the_sea/dm0mn2w/)) (This is StabbyKaji's second win in a row. Consider this a challenge to topple her next month!) (Also: congrats Kaji, you minx!)\n * 2nd Place Overall Story: /u/fringly ([story](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6vghpi/cw_flash_fiction_challenge_location_the_sea/dm0csb6/))\n * 3rd Place Overall Story: /u/WinsomeJesse ([story](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6vghpi/cw_flash_fiction_challenge_location_the_sea/dm0tse3/))\n * Most Aww-Inducing Story: /u/shuflearn ([story](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6vghpi/cw_flash_fiction_challenge_location_the_sea/dm05mc4/))\n * Most Creative Story: /u/GregoryGoose ([story](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6vghpi/cw_flash_fiction_challenge_location_the_sea/dm0fk5w/)) (I really liked the structure of this story... it was almost a poem? Very neat.)\n * Most Unexpected Story: /u/ssjvash ([story](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6vghpi/cw_flash_fiction_challenge_location_the_sea/dm0s1jf/))\n * Most Initially Unconcerned About the Word Limit: /u/Twoisnoe ([story](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6vghpi/cw_flash_fiction_challenge_location_the_sea/dm0pi3r/)) (they wrote 1790+ words before cutting back to the word limit! Whaaaat?!)\n * Best Continued Story From the First FFC: /u/Nate_Parker ([story](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6vghpi/cw_flash_fiction_challenge_location_the_sea/dm1epnf/))\n * Best Use of Drop Caps: /u/N1MBUS905([story](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6vghpi/cw_flash_fiction_challenge_location_the_sea/dm1r5my/)) (what's that? You didn't know that you can use drop caps in WritingPrompts? Well, [now you do!](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/fancy))\n &amp;nbsp;\n\nCongratulations to the winners!

After years of hard work and paying her dues she would finally be the first person to set foot on Mars. It was a great honor of course but she had proven herself worthy of it, she had passed all the tests and pushed herself harder than her competitors but it would all be worth it when she thought of that first, slightly bouncier than normal, step on the red planet that she would take. Her crew was equally happy, spending seven years with only five other people can be rough, but today made all the small annoyances pale in comparison. They would make history together, they would do what no one else had ever done. It was a relatively small crew for such a historic mission but Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins had only been three when they made themselves immortal 133 years ago by walking on the moon.\n\n \u201cIsn\u2019t she a beauty, Commander,\u201d said Chief Engineer Scott as he weightlessly descended, or ascended depending on your point of view, the ladder from the common area to the observation window in the cockpit. He looked towards the huge red orb hanging out there in space, enough mass to warrant being called a planet. From their position far above the planet they had a perfect view of the mountains and valleys that stretched the surface. Each sand storm, clearly visible from on high, was striking in its beauty as it tore with viscous force along the red desert planes. The distance to the planet enhanced its beauty and they couldn\u2019t do anything but marvel at Mars. \n\n\u201cYes, she is. And we get to be the first ones to appreciate her. How\u2019s the crew doing?\u201d Ellis responded.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all fine, better than fine now that we\u2019ll get out of this tub. Einarsdottir is taking final measurements and triple checking the landing site\u2026 again\u2026 How someone can be that interested in rocks is beyond me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be glad she took her time when we don\u2019t have to sprint back to the ship because an avalanche is coming our way or the landing site is about to fall through to an underground cave,\u201d she responded with a smile, she was too excited to keep the edge in her voice that she was going for. It was generally not a good idea to let Scott continue with smaller jabs about other crew members since isolation didn\u2019t work well with his dry sense of humor.\n\n\u201cOf course, I was just kidding Commander. I know what it would mean for us to land in a red or even yellow zone. So anyway, Einarsdottir is playing with her little rock models, Kapoor is looking through his kit again and planning all the chemical tests he\u2019s going to conduct when we get down there. He\u2019s almost as giddy as Sara with her rocks. Vasiliev is in the cargo bay, trying to work off some of the excess energy before we enter a stable orbit, that\u2019s a physicist for you, always playing around with energy, mass and motion. And M\u00e5nsson is taking some shut eyes since he\u2019s going to be sitting behind the wheel in a couple hours and didn\u2019t want to take a stim before taking us in, might be superstitious,\u201d said Scott as he glanced around the otherwise empty cockpit, looking for something to distract him.\n\n\u201cOr you could say he\u2019s being responsible, and why exactly are you here right now, bugging me while I\u2019m trying to make sure we don\u2019t fly into an asteroid or cooked by stray radiation?\u201d \n\n\u201cI just couldn\u2019t do another ship maintenance pass. I\u2019ve been over her ten times in the last day, checking and re-checking everything. But right now my mind can only think of one thing, this time tomorrow we will be standing on Mars! I just can\u2019t believe it, it feels so surreal. I can remember earth almost like a past life. Small memories of what my life used to be\u2026 Staring out into space every time I look out the window, not seeing anyone else except you guys\u2026 I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s enough to drive you mad. But here we are, at the end of a seven year journey and about to be the first people from Earth to stand on another planet! I guess I just couldn\u2019t sit still in my bunk and watch more holos from the friends back home knowing I won\u2019t see them for at least seven more years even if we would turn back right now,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know what you mean, it\u2019s not\u2026\u201d The alarms blared out from the speakers in rapid succession. Three short BEEPS came through the speakers as both their complants beeped in matching rhythm as well, giving them an instant connection to the ship and the source of the alarm. Einarsdottir\u2019s voice came through the complants straight into their auditory nerves just as the alarm died away.\n\u201cSorry everyone, I was readjusting the sensors to pick up better quality scans and had set the computer to ping my complant in case it found anything we didn\u2019t expect but it started the moment I turned it on, didn\u2019t have time to warn you.\u201d\n\n\u201cSara, don\u2019t let that happen again. We can\u2019t afford any mistakes now,\u201d Ellis responded, this time without any problems of adding an edge to her voice. \u201cJust because we reached Mars doesn\u2019t mean we are taking procedures less seriously.\u201d \n\n\u201cYes Commander, sorry,\u201d was the apologetic response. \n\n\u201cWhat did the computer find?\u201d M\u00e5nsson\u2019s voice came through the com line with a bit of haze to it. \n\n\u201cSorry that I woke you Johan. It found something strange\u2026 I\u2019m looking at the readings now and it looks like\u2026 A massive deposit of titanium buried in the mountains about 100 clicks north of our landing site.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, Titanium? That can\u2019t be right? We\u2019ve scanned the planet for years from Earth and didn\u2019t find a shred of Titanium,\u201d Vasiliev\u2019s deep voice came through the complant. To the others, it sounded like he was standing right next to them.\n\n\u201cAccording to the readings it looks like its buried deep into the mountains and the sensors back on Earth could have missed it if we weren\u2019t aligned exactly right. I\u2019ll send over a visual on the complant,\u201d said Einarsdottir. As one by one accepted the visual, their surroundings disappeared as the complant slowly faded in the visual over their regular vision by hooking up to their optics nerves directly. Soon they saw nothing but the display that Sara was controlling from the lab on board.\n\n\u201cSee this section here,\u201d a shape became visible on the representation they were seeing. \u201cI am reading some sort of interconnected cavern system with strong readings of titanium. The entrance has only minimal traces but as soon as it goes a bit deeper, a kilometer or so, the more titanium we find,\u201d she said, a bit of hesitation in her voice.\n\n\u201cWas not this expected? That we would find things that we could not see from earth or even from the satellites orbiting mars?\u201d Asked Kapoor.\n\n\u201cWell yes and no, we of course expected to make new findings and take more detailed samples of the environment\u2026 but this\u2026 this is something very unexpected. Even with extremely small traces of rare metals we should have seen them from earth of the very least from the Encounter probe, the satellite checked this sector 13 months ago. It\u2019s like it just appeared since then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to get down there and take some more in-depth readings on location, for now just mark the site in the nav computer and continue with the scans, maybe we find more of these unexplained phenomenon\u2019s,\u201d ordered Ellis. \n\n\u201cYes, Commander. I\u2019m marking down the coordinates in the computer and resuming the scan and routing all results to my complant only,\u201d responded Einarsdottir.\n\n\u201cHow long until it\u2019s my turn to fly this bucket?\u201d Came M\u00e5nsson\u2019s still groggy voice through the com network, this time to Ellis only. \n\u201c130 minutes until you\u2019re scheduled to take over, we\u2019ll be in orbit then and take a pass around the planet before we set her down in just over 6 hours,\u201d responded Ellis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try squeeze out all the sleep I can before then, see you in 130\u2026 Here\u2019s hoping that there won\u2019t be any new alarms going off,\u201d he said and went back to bed.\n\n\n83 Minutes later the alarms, uncooperatively, sounded again, this time somehow with more panic in the emotionless beeps.\n\u201cSkit ocks\u00e5! What the hell Sara, it\u2019s been less than an hour and a\u2026\u201d M\u00e5nsson\u2019s voice died instantly as he saw information appear on his retina from the complant.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me!\u201d She responded just as the Commanders voice rang out throughout the ship.\n\n\u201cAction stations, brace for impact!\u201d she said as she veered the ship in a complicated maneuver. They could feel the pull of the planets gravity in their guts as the ship continued to do a pirouette in space. A few seconds later the commanders\u2019 voice sounded through the ship\u2019s speakers as well as the complants internal feed.\n\n\u201cEveryone meet me up here in the cockpit except you Scott, you go down to the engine room and make sure I didn\u2019t blow anything we need during that spin. Report back in twenty with a complete analysis,\u201d she said to the already disappearing pair of feet that floated away from her towards the engines. Everyone else gathered up in the cockpit together with the Commander.\n\n\u201cOhooiet, what the hell just happened Commander?\u201d Said Vasiliev as he entered the cockpit and joined the others already there.\n\n\u201cWe were just attacked Viktor,\u201d she responded into the room. For a few seconds no one spoke as they contemplated the meaning of what Ellis had just said. She could see them processing the information, trying to make sense of her words. It was Kapoor who first spoke again.\n\n\u201cAttacked? What do you mean? Nothing that we left on the Revelation could have possibly been used as a weapon, and even so, Athena would have warned us if something malfunctioned and dislodged from the ship, she\u2019s a very thorough AI.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. Only, what attacked us didn\u2019t come from our own ship. It came from Mars.\u201d \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t understand\u2026\u201d Vasiliev broke in.\n\n\u201cSomething on that planet fired a missile capable of leaving the atmosphere and hitting space crafts, from the specs we scanned it looked like some serious fire power even if the guidance system was a bit slow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut nothing down there should have that capability Commander. By law and treaty all the probes and robots that have been sent to Mars haven\u2019t had any military material. And where was it even launched from? We\u2019ve had continuous visual scans from the planet for the last 16 months in preparation for this landing and not once have we seen anything that resembles anything that is advanced enough to launch a freaking missile into space!\u201d\n\nM\u00e5nsson\u2019s voice was raised and he looked a little pale. Life in space was definitely not risk free but he wasn\u2019t expecting a war zone when he signed up for this mission.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, the fact remains that we were just attacked. The computer estimates the launch site to somewhere in this radius. Notice that the mysterious titanium deposit is located just 14 kilometers from the center of this area. I refuse to believe the coincidence that we discover a hitherto unknown source of raw material where there shouldn\u2019t be right before we are attacked from the very same area,\u201d again the room fell silent as the Commander finished speaking.\n\n\u201cSo what do we do now? I mean, we can\u2019t really go down to the planet right? It seems like suicide to take six astronauts down to a hostile planet,\u201d Scott\u2019s voice joined the others from the engine room. \u201cBy the way, we\u2019re fine. That maneuver you pulled might have pushed this shuttle to its limits but I\u2019m not complaining as you just saved all our lives and everything.\u201d \n\n\u201cI sent the initial alarm and the first all clear to ground control the second I dodged that missile. Unfortunately since it takes 14 minutes for the message to receive Earth and as long to return plus whatever time they take figuring out what the hell we mean by \u2018attacked\u2019 I say we can\u2019t really count on them for anything in the present. I\u2019ve already turned this shuttle around back to Revelation and informed Athena that we are making an emergency docking and to move the ships a couple of hundred kilometers away as soon as we are latched on again,\u201d just as Ellis finished that sentence the alarms rang out again, this time warning lights flashed as the shuttle now recognized the missiles as an emergency and not just an anomaly.\n\n\u201cTwo more incoming!\u201d M\u00e5nsson\u2019s voice was tense.\n\n\u201cI see them, give me a trajectory! When will they reach us?\u201d Was the commanders\u2019 response.\n\n\u201cOne second, they\u2019re pretty far out\u2026 Hmm\u2026 It looks like\u2026 Commander! They\u2019re not on a collision course with us! They\u2019re going for Revelation!\u201d M\u00e5nsson looked up from his controls and out the window where they saw the faint spotlights lighting up the Revelations gleaming hull. Commander Ellis thought the instructions over to the AI on board the Revelation through her complant which relayed them through the shuttles transmitter. \u201cGet the ship out of there now, move it back 200 kilometers, scan objects in a 1000 kilometer radius and course correct any projected collision,\u201d she thought with desperation.\n\n\u201cOrder will move Revelation out of the maximum pickup range for the shuttle. Order cannot be executed without the commanders\u2019 verbal confirmation,\u201d was the calm voice of millions of ones and zeros trying its best pretending to be a real thinking entity.\n\u201cConfirmed by Commander Karen Ellis, execute my previous order,\u201d she screamed in her mind. If the ship got damaged they would have nothing. The communication equipment, their AI and all the other necessities of the project where on board that ship. All they had on the planet was the automated habitat that had been sent years in advance together with their food, water and air supply. But all of that was just a means of dying slower she thought, if we lose that ship we might as well open the door right now and be done with it, anything else is just prolonging the inevitable. She watched with agony as the shuttle reported the relative movement of the larger space ship. Inch by inch it started turning until it was finally in position to enable the boosters and get out of there. Just as the engines ignited she saw the two missile dots enter the \u2018minimal safety threshold\u2019, even if they blew up now by some miracle there was no guarantee that the ship would make it out without a scratch. Revelation started accelerating more and more yet it was still slower than the missiles. They were closing in, even if they gained less and less for each second. She realized what would happen a second before the AI voice contacted her in her head. \n\n\u201cCourse correction not successful, unidentified objects still on collision course. All attempts to avoid disaster failed. Impact is imminent, projected collision in 14, 13, 12, 11\u2026\u201d The countdown lasted only seconds but as the missiles neared Revelation, Commander Ellis saw the meaning flash before her eyes. No communication with Earth or any way of getting home. Any replacement ship would take seven years to send if they sent one today. But there was no way they could do that, a new ship had to be re purposed and outfitted, the process could take months. On the other hand, what difference did those months make to those that had less than eight weeks of supply, it wasn\u2019t like they would have enough time to hold on those extra months. \u201c...4, 3, 2, 1\u2026\u201d The explosions brightened up their windows for a moment and they were bathed in strong light coming off of the nuclear engine of Revelation as it exploded into thousands of pieces right before their eyes. As the oxygen disappeared into the vacuum, so did the fires and soon there was nothing left to see in the darkness of space of the ship that had been their home for seven years. A cold fear seized the crew that they hadn\u2019t experienced yet on their journey, while they had known of the risks of space travel and of the unforgiving nature of the laws of the universe, they hadn\u2019t even given a though that something out here was actively trying to kill them. They felt bare in space, a few millimeters of metal separating them and nothingness with missiles out there on the loose.\n\u201cWe have been robbed of the choice, I\u2019m taking the ship down to the surface. At least we have water, food and air there, there is nothing out here anymore for us,\u201d said the Commander as she once more steered the shuttle down towards the red planet.\n\u201cWhat! We can\u2019t do that! Whoever fired those missiles are down there. We\u2019re just going down there to face God knows how many more of them and whatever weapons they have,\u201d Scott\u2019s voice broke through the comms again. Ellis knew it was the panic speaking, Scott wasn\u2019t really suggesting they chance the trip back to earth in a shuttle designed for maximum a week in space.\n\u201cMy call!\u201d She responded. \u201cEveryone get back to your stations and get ready for an emergency landing. We\u2019re not going to take it slow and let them line up a shot again. We\u2019ll enter orbit on a site far enough from the habitat so that we won\u2019t leave a literal trail in the heavens pointing to where we are. I need you all at your stations!\u201d\n\nEveryone hurried off to their monitors to monitor whatever was their responsibility. The shuttle seemed extra cramp for some reason now, as if the compartments were smaller than just 20 minutes ago, as if there was less air inside and each panicked breath was taking a another small yet vital portion of the breathable air away. Commander Ellis steered the ship down towards the planet along a path that a drunk would have chosen. It crisscrossed in all three dimensions so as to not give whoever was presumably out there, watching them, a clean shot. Those years in the air force serving as a combat pilot was ample training for what she was doing now and the instructions she had heard years ago came back as a memory enhanced by her complant. \u201cIf you find yourself in a shit place to be, first figure out where you would rather want to be and set a course there. But you don\u2019t want to point a big arrow and say \u2018I am going this way\u2019 so move erratically, like you\u2019re flying the ship drunk of your asses. In fact, if you\u2019re in that of a shitty position, have a shot and fly it a bit more convincingly like a drunk!\u201d Her senior NCO had a way with words\u2026 She snatched her mind back to the present and took a hard left, always steering away from the missiles point of origin.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s everyone doing? Do we have eyes for more incoming,\u201d she asked out to the ship.\n\n\u201cShuttle\u2019s sensors are all clear here Commander,\u201d someone responded, she was too focused to remember who.\n\n\u201cThe radiological sensors are all green Commander, nothing coming towards us,\u201d this time she managed to hone in on the voice and hear Vasiliev respond. As if his words had some sort of magical power, the cockpit was plunged into darkness. Every single light on board was switched off, together with the engines, computers and anything else powered by electricity. The only electronics that stayed on were their complants, shielded inside their heads from the kind of EMP bursts that could render a ship such as theirs inert. If not for the very real possibility of dying at any second, it would have been comical\u2026 here they were, at the very end of the long journey, survivors of an odyssey that could surely be counted as the culmination of humanities greatest combined effort and they were about to die crashing into the planet they had spent years trying to reach because someone had put something down there that had fired on them. It was almost like dying of thirst at sea, so close yet so far away. She hadn\u2019t ordered them to put on suits since she thought that there was no point after Revelation blew up. It would just slow them down when moving around the shuttle and if it blew, what kind of protection would the suits give. But now, as the shuttle was being dragged down by the inescapable forces of gravity she ordered them all into suits. Just in case they managed to make it alive to the surface somehow.\n\n\u201cWe lost main power. Everything except the complants that run on our biological energy is down. We are hurtling towards the planet at an alarming speed but we just might have a shot, we aren\u2019t that far away from the LZ,\u201d said the Commander. They strapped in to their seats as they were passing the outer layers of the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an honor serving with you and even though we didn\u2019t get to stand on Mars, I\u2019m proud to say that we did everything we could have done to complete our mission and expand the borders of the human ra\u2026\u201d For a second the monitor in front of her flashed and went out again.\n\n\u201cHold that thought commander! Looks like I got the engines back on!\u201d Shouted Scott with a crazed happiness in his voice. And unlike the sudden darkness that had surrounded them, the light started to flicker back, one or two at a time. The computer made a whirring sound, like something spinning up slowly and building more and more speed. They weren\u2019t designed to ever turn off so everyone on board prayed to whatever deity they held dear that everything booted up properly and quickly as they saw more and more of Mars and less and less of space through the windows. As they fell towards the ground the very friction of the air caused an immense heat buildup and soon the view was engulfed in flames. The shuttle was coming down with a much greater speed than designed. It was only because the engineers back home at the agency had this lovely policy of \u2018Only need one? Take three, just in case!\u2019 that the plating held, as it was many times thicker than the planned landing procedure needed. After what seemed like an eternity the navigational controls lit up and Ellis seized the controls and immediately did her best to keep the ship from crashing into the ground that was rapidly closing in. Just as she managed to straighten the ship out the proximity alarm flashed and she could see why. Up ahead, a mountain was fast approaching right in their way. She pulled with all her strength on the controls and managed to fight the momentum of the ship, it started turning and just as the mountain passed, one small cliff hit the starboard wing and they went down\u2026\n",

Of course posted with permission from Lexi. ;) (She will forever be mentioned here, in this unchanging introduction)\n\nThe goal is to put unknown writers into the spotlight! This will be accomplished by scrolling through writingprompts and making a selection each week. I also only choose prompts that received less than twenty-five upvotes so it is more likely the prompt replies were seen by few eyes.\n\nI also take suggestions! For details see the bottom.\n\n**Personal notes:**\n-------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------\n\nEight months have passed  \nA single third left  \nPleasant cold, please return  \n\n&lt;3\n\nWithout further delay\n\n**The invisible prompts**\n-------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------\n\n* [Prompt one](https://redd.it/6wj0yr) [WP] \"You know what? I'm actually not even here to take you back. I just want to know how the hell does someone like you escape a maximum security prison with nothing but a rope and a seam ripper.\"\n\nPosted by u/actually_crazy_irl\n\nHahahaha. Sounds like a good movie opening!\n\n---\n\n* [Prompt two](https://redd.it/6wh0u0) [IP] Fade Away\n\nPosted by u/Syraphia\n\nA beautiful image. &lt;3\n\n---\n\n* [Prompt three](https://redd.it/6whdfg) [WP] It's the start of a brand new sci-fi adventure. But the main character is a wizard.\n\nPosted by u/PatTraX\n\nMagic! ~\n\n---\n\n* [Prompt four](https://redd.it/6wg82w) [WP] \"You were supposed to stop me,\" he whispered to the grave before him.\n\nPosted by u/Vercalos\n\nHe must have done or lost something bad. o-o \n\n---\n\n* [Prompt five](https://redd.it/6wgar3) [WP] \u201cSir, you\u2019ve just been mugged. We think they stole some memories, is there anything you can\u2019t remember?\u201d\n\nPosted by u/ArchCrono\n\nHow old am I?\n\n---\n\n* [Prompt six](https://redd.it/6wcbn3) [IP] An album of horror \n\nPosted by u/Loveroflife344\n\nChoose from horror and write! O-O\n\n---\n\n* [Prompt seven](https://redd.it/6wdjc7) [WP] A depressed man moves into a haunted house with 7 demons, each corresponding to the 7 deadly sins. Rather than haunting him, however, they try to get him back on his feet.\n\nPosted by u/flammabledoritos\n\nSweet sins. &lt;3\n\n**Do you have a suggestion?!**\n-------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------\n\nYes, a starship troopers inspired line. ;) You can pm me any prompt you like as long they fulfill the following criteria:\n\n* The prompt was posted within two weeks before the invisible prompts was posted. I post this each Tuesday so take a look at the date for the upcoming Tuesday to determine if the prompt was posted in the right timeframe. Of course being a few hours over time is not a problem. \n\n* The prompt itself received only 25 or less upvotes. \n\n* The prompt must have one reply in it. The goal is after all to showcase writers. :)\n\n-------------------------------\n\n[The Invisible Prompts from 22-August-2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/6vdgeb/ot_the_invisible_prompts/)\f",

The Redeemer is ready for combat operations, Sky Brother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you AASI. Time to move out.\u201d\n\nThe Redeemer, a 25-meter-tall, heavily armored humanoid robot. I know, somewhat clich\u00e9, but it always got the job done. Triple Obelisk Heavy laser on both hands, heat-seeking missiles, jet powered limbs, additional plasma weaponry, shoulder mounted flamethrowers, etc\u2026 A walking armory of destruction. Shame M.A.R.V. and the Eradicator weren\u2019t here, they would have provided pretty nice firepower. But, I had to make due with whatever was available. And besides, The Redeemer was the fastest of the three. \n\nAs the Redeemer was running full speed towards the coast, I could see the battle on the monitors \u2013 it was getting more and more vicious. With majority of the Syndicate either downed or evacuated, whoever was left was going all out. The Seven were trying to fight Phantom on even ground, but I knew better, didn\u2019t I? He wasn\u2019t truly trying\u2026 If he wanted, he could have killed everyone thre. Yet, there were no fatalities \u2013 he knew exactly how to beat everyone without killing them. Why? Even now, I ask myself that. Did he want them to be humiliated? Leave them alive so they could, eventually, join him? Or was it some type of twisted morality of his? Or everything combined?... \n\nAs Phantom got close to striking Breeze, he suddenly stopped and narrowly avoided the giant fist of the leaping Redeemer coning down. The ground shook as it landed. Phantom looked at the robot, smiled. \u201cNow this is getting interesting.\u201d\n\nI zipped up the interface suit. \u201cThis is where the fun begins\u201d, I said to myself, getting into the \u201cHamster ball\u201d. I strapped myself and put on the control helmet, then I turned on the loudspeaker on the Redeemer: \n\n\u201cThis is Sky Brother. The cavalry has arrived. ASSUMING DIRECT CONTROLL\u201d. As I slammed my fist into the open palm, so did the Redeemer.\n\n\u201c \u2018Bout time!\u201d \u2013 I could hear enthusiasm come back to Electron\u2019s voice. \u201cAlright people, it\u2019s now or never! No one messes with us and gets away with it!\u201d\n\nIt was indeed, now or never. Only Elemental Seven and couple of heroes were still standing. Everyone else had been defeated and evacuated by my recovery drones\u2026\n\n\u201cThis is it everyone. Elemental Seven, power up to the max. Everyone else, retreat to the Mother Base.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is an order. If this doesn\u2019t work, we will need a last line of defense!\u201d\n\nPhantom looked on as most of the remaining heroes started to retreat. He made no attempt to stop them, more curious about what were the Seven up to.  They slowly started to fully transform, becoming purely made of the elements they controlled. The Elemental Seven at their fullest. The ground shook from the power unleashed. They all had never gone all out all seven at the same time, only three at max. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Each of them could destroy the island in mere moments, but I still somehow knew that it wouldn\u2019t have be enough. But we had to try\u2026\n\nThe battle raged on. The Redeemer was heavily armored and had pretty powerful energy shielding, so for a while it could tank Phantom\u2019s energy blasts. With me piloting it, Phantom had pretty hard time attacking anyone else, and most of his blasts were deflected from the robot. The Seven started to get some hits in, Electron even managing to engage him in hand-to-hand fight for some time. But still, no matter how many hits we got in, he was not showing any signs of slowing down. I had to come up with a plan\u2026\n\n\u201cGuys, I got a plan. Uploading to your HUDs now\u201d\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Electron answered \u2013 \u201cThis is so crazy it might actually work. Alright, Hydro, Breeze, Magma, Icecap, you know what to do, get on it. We will keep him busy!\u201d\n\nWe continued to battle Phantom, while the others broke off towards the shore. Magma created a wall of fire. Hydro raised above the ocean. She motioned her hands and water below her started to follow her hands. She started spinning, creating vortex of water. She stopped and directed the water towards the wall of fire. The resulting stream on the other side was picked up by the winds made by Breeze. In several seconds there was a mist in the area. Phantom stopped in the air, seemingly confused. \n\nBreeze started to condense the mist towards the Phantom. Before he could do anything, Icecap leapt into the air, charged up for a moment, \u201cGet Cover!!!\u201d he shouted, with everyone creating protective bubble of their elements, and then he unleashed a wave of energy from him. The next moment, everything in 100-meter radius was frozen solid. In the middle, there was a frozen \u201cstatue\u201d of Phantom, in the mountain of ice. The Redeemer leapt into the air \u201cThis ends NOW!\u201d I shouted and brought the fist of the robot down on the \u201cstatue\u201d of the Phantom. I could hear the ice shatter and the fist went all the way to the ground. \n\n\u201cGotcha you sonnava bit\u2026  WHAT???\u201d\n\nMy celebrations were cut short when the arm of The Redeemer stated to rise slowly. I increased the pressure, trying to crush him. \n\n\u201cENOUGH!!!\u201d I heard the shout and the next thing was Redeemer\u2019s hand forcefully thrust up. It stumbled back. I changed to the Obelisk lasers, but before I could fire it an energy blast from Phantom obliterated Redeemer\u2019s right hand and the laser along with it. I fired the salvo of heat-seeking missiles, emptying the entire ammo reserve in one attack\u2026 But he dodged them. ALL of them. So fast in fact hat he was leaving after images, with no way to pinpoint him. I prepped the rest of the weaponry, but before I could do anything, another energy blast took out the head of the Redeemer. I lost visual. \n\n\u201cI will go third-person on your ass!!!\u201d I turned on the drone camera feeds. I tried to hit him with Redeemer\u2019s arms. After several dodges, Phantom unleashed another beam, striking at the core of the Redeemer, disabling the robot for good\u2026 It fell down to its knees, inactive.\n\n\u201cDamn, I\u2019m gonna miss that robot\u201d- said Electron. Phantom turned his attention towards the Seven. Suddenly he raised his hand, just in time to stop the kick from the Atlas, sending shockwave through the area. He was done playing with us\u2026\n\u201cSkyfall prototype is ready to fire Sky Brother\u201d \u2013 reported AASI. \u201cRight on time\u201d I thought to myself. I looked at the monitors \u2013 the Elemental Seven were barely standing\u2026 I was sure it was the only way, so I pressed the button. \n\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d \u2013 I could hear perplexed Electron on the comms as the first blue beam of the secondary beams came down near the edge of the island. Then came the other seven, one after another, arranged in a circle around the battlefield. \u201cThe Ion Cannon?! You said it was still in testing phase!\u201d \n\n\u201cNo test like field test\u201d I answered. \u201cGet out of there, now!\u201d \n\n\u201cElemental Seven, WE ARE LEAVING!\u201d \u2013 commanded Electron. Their retreat was cut off with Phantoms beam going along the ground, making a line between the battlefield and the rest of the island. \n\n\u201cWhere do you think you are going?\u201d\n\nThe beams started gradually spinning inwards. We were running out of time. I had to do it\u2026\n\n\u201cHow about we finish this?\u201d \u2013 asked Phantom. He opened his palm, charging an energy beam, but before he could do anything, the seven suddenly vanished. \n\n\u201cTeleportation successful. No soul loss detected\u201d- announced AASI. I breathed the sigh of relief and rushed towards them in the receiver. They were injured, but still conscious. Electron looked at me, understanding that had just happened. \u201cIon strike imminent. Activating defenses. Lockdown initiated.\u201d \n\n\u201cCan Mother Base take it?\u201d- he asked me. \n\n\u201cYes. The shielding will sustain damage, but it can withstand it. Let\u2019s hope _he_ can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\nMother Base started going into lockdown, closing windows, rolling over heavy blast shields, each capable of withstanding a direct nuclear hit. With last of them closed, the only light that was coming from the lights inside the base. The ground shook more and more as the secondary beams were closing in on the center. The air on the island was ionizing\u2026\n\n\u201cMain beam firing in 5\u2026 4\u2026 3\u2026 2\u2026 1...\u201d\nWe heard the beam go off, and after that \u2013 a giant explosion, obliterating most of the island. The base shook violently for several seconds, and then \u2013 quiet. \n\n\u201cI am become death, the destroyer of worlds\u201d \u2013 I said. Now I understood what Oppenheimer felt on that fateful day. The only thing was that I had something much worse to fear than my own creation\u2026\n\nThe heroes that could still walk gathered near the main gate. Some thought we should have checked the damage outside, some said we should hole up and see what would happen. Before a consensus was made, we heard a metal clang coming from the blast door of the gate. The next moment, the blast door designed to withstand nukes blew open, sending most of it flying into the hangar. We all looked in horror at the figure at our doorstep, illuminated by the light coming from outside. We could barely see Phantom standing in the light. I expected an angry shout, or something furious, but what I heard horrified me more than any angry shout or furious voice could do. Instead, I heard in calm and collected voice:\n\n\u201cThat\u2026 Tickled\u201d \n\n\u2026\n\n\nAnd that brings us here.  All of the Syndicate is mostly huddled in the hanger, being guarded by Phantom\u2019s goons. There are also some familiar faces: Verax, Mendacium, several others\u2026 Phantom had rallied most of the villains behind him, all under his command. We are facing the Syndicate of Evil, with Phantom as it\u2019s leader. He walks up the tribune Electron was supposed to address us from\u2026 From where we would hear about another successful year protecting the earth. Now we would hear about how we failed from that very spot\u2026 I look at the cameras. All of them are shut down\u2026.\n\n\u201cBefore I address the world, MY new world, I want to address all you here \u2013 the so called heroes, personally\u201d \u2013he starts Phantom. \u201cI offered you the chance to join me, but you refused me. Now? Now you will pay the price for your decision.\u201d He raises his hand. I feel invisible force grabs me, and I slowly start to float towards the tribune. Breeze screams, others ask for them to be taken, some try to wrestle only to be subdued by Phantom\u2019s men. I try to struggle but it\u2019s no use. I\u2019m only human after all\u2026  I arrive at the platform. Phantom Turns me midair towards the Syndicate, then brings me to my knees. I see the weapon in his hands \u2013 my own Colt Python. Ironic asshole. \n\nI look at the Syndicate. I see the desperation and sorrow in their eyes. Why me? Because he wanted to have revenge for every time I intervened? Did he view me as actual challenge or threat? Or because he thought it would be the most painful sting in the heart of the Syndicate? After all, he could see how they looked at me. Some pleaded\u2026 Or he had no use for me since\u2026 I am only human after all\u2026  Maybe I\u2019m foolish to still have hope of some miracle saving us\u2026  Maybe I\u2019m blind that I can\u2019t see the reality\u2026 \n\nThere is no miracle coming, no surprise rescue, nothing -  this is the end for Sky Brother. I sigh\u2026 \u201cSo much for \u201cnormal life\u201d. This is the end of it.\u201d \n\nI ask myself: Did I try my best? Did I go wrong somewhere? Was all this my fault? My mistake? But, in the end, I am only human after all... I made mistakes\u2026 I tell myself not to put the blame on me\u2026\n\nI look at the Syndicate\u2026 one last time. I see my family hurt. I see Electron, my best friend, on his knees. His eyes don\u2019t shine with his endless optimism. They are just\u2026 empty. My eyes cross with Breeze. We look each other in the eyes. I can see tears streaming down her cheeks. The ring is still in my pocket\u2026 Once the celebrations were in motion I was gonna... It doesn\u2019t matter now. We both know that this is the end\u2026\n\nI feel cold steel on the back of my head. I close my eyes. I hear the cocking of the hammer.\n\nThe last thing I, Sky Brother hear, is the shot of my own revolver behind me\u2026.\n\nDarkness\u2026\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHope you enjoyed Part 5. Next up, the final part, Part 6: Revelations. \n\nBefore that, go ahead and speculate about past parts. And maybe you might find some easter eggs too ;)\n",

            "selftext": "---\n#Friday: A Novel Idea\n\n\nHello Everyone! \n\nWelcome to /u/MNBrian\u2019s guide to noveling, aptly called **Friday: A Novel Idea**, where we discuss the full process of how to write a book from start to finish.\n\nThe ever-incredible and exceptionally brilliant **/u/you-are-lovely** came up with the wonderful idea of putting together a series on how to write a novel from start to finish. And it sounded spectacular to me!\n\nSo what makes me qualified to provide advice on noveling? Good question! Here are the cliff notes.\n\n* For one, I devote a great deal of my time to helping out writers on Reddit because I too am a writer! \n\n* In addition, I\u2019ve completed three novels and am working on my fourth. \n\n* And I also work as a reader for a literary agent.\n\n\nThis means I read query letters and novels (also known as fulls, short for full novels that writers send to my agent by request) and I give my opinion on the work. My agent then takes those opinions (after reading the novel as well) and makes a decision on where to go from there. \n\n\nBut enough about that. Let\u2019s dive in!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n## Housekeeping\n\nAs we enter the final third of posts I have left in my series on how to write a novel from start to finish, I'd like to touch on some housekeeping items. You see, most of us writers are more like hamster's on a wheel. We aren't content just to write our book. We must worry about literally everything **related** to books as well. And as we see things on twitter like #PitMad (seriously, go check it out, it's rad) and other Twitter competitions, or we hear words like \"querying\" and \"agent\" and \"editor\" -- we can't help but google these things and go down the rabbit hole.\n\nSo this post, really, is my attempt at saving you from yourself (and perhaps re-saving myself from myself as well).\n\nLet's jump into it!\n\n---\n\n## The Hamster Wheel of Things We Stress Out About\n\n\n### Book Length\n\nThe rules tell you that books ought to be a certain length. And it's true. They ought to. Not because there is some magical universal rule that tells us that books must be a certain length, but because we live in a physical world and we're all weird about expectations. Let's illustrate the point with another point.\n\nWhen I went to Central America, I had the opportunity to scale a Mayan temple. It was pretty awesome. I remember as I looked on the temple from afar, I was just stunned at the beauty of the place. But when I got to the foot of the stairs and tried to step on the first step, my toe slammed into the side of the step and I nearly fell face first onto the stairs. I looked down, confused at what had just happened, then lifted my foot an extra 5 inches up and started climbing. It became clear what had happened as I continued my way up the stairs. You see, my body was so used to steps being a certain height, that my foot literally lifted that height and crashed right into the side of a Mayan step, a full 5-6 inches higher than what I was used to. Even the depth of the steps was different than what felt normal. There wasn't enough room on any step for my whole foot. Even when I turned my foot sideways, a part of my foot would still hang off the edge of the step.\n\nIt may seem strange, but climbing those steps was the first time I realized how powerful expectation is. I mean, it's just a staircase. I was just climbing stairs, something I've done many thousand times over my lifetime, yet it felt so much more dangerous and so different to climb stairs that were the \"wrong\" height. But of course, there is no natural law that says stairs should always be 10 inches high and six inches deep. It's just what my foot happened to be accustomed to.\n\nThe same goes for movies. When we sit in on a movie and the film goes on for 3 and a half hours... we notice. It's not like the world ends. It just might bug us. It's annoying. It pulls us out of the film and back into the world as we try to figure out how much longer the film is. I mean, it's not like we don't binge-watch 12 straight hours of Netflix. It's not like our brains can't handle consuming that much video. It just comes back to our mental expectation.\n\nAnd this is why book length matters, at least a little. Even if you self-publish your book, you will get comments from readers that say \"too long\" or \"too short\" if you don't fall within a consumer's expected range. \n\nNow, the reason you shouldn't be freaking out about it is this: You can get to some of this in editing by either beefing up or cutting down on your manuscript. So yes, maybe pay some attention to word length. Plenty of posts on word count for specific genres are posted online. But don't let it derail your progress. Finish your book first. Figure out how to fix it and sell it later. Tell your story first -- the best possible story you can tell.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n### Trends -- And Getting In Early\n\nA writer friend reached out to me to ask me about a book they were working on. They were still drafting the book, but they felt like based on some current events, that their book had hit the lottery. Maybe finishing it and putting it out as fast as possible would put them at the front of the wave of new books in the beginning of a new trend!\n\nI told my friend that it's excellent that the book feels so current and fresh, but maybe we should consider a few other things.\n\nFor one, if she wants to have that book traditionally published, she'll need an agent and that agent has to sell to an editor at some publishing house, and even if all that happened at light-speed and was done by tomorrow morning, she'd still be waiting roughly a year for the publication date. Who knows what trends will be popular in a year? Who knows what books will sell well?\n\nSecondly, if she slams out this book and with little editing, self publishes it instead -- you end up with a sub-par product. And consumers who are faced with two books about similar topics, one that has been well edited and is conceptually strong, and another that is a rough draft with spelling/grammar errors corrected, will generally choose the more polished product. Getting there first doesn't always mean selling the most books.\n\nThirdly, who knows what is currently in the pipeline, or what authors currently have done. Maybe Stephen King recently wrote a book on that same topic, and it's all edited and ready, and his publication date is next week. You can't beat that train. Or maybe he has this book done and polished and ready and decides to take a stab at self-publishing tomorrow. So maybe first isn't exactly first after all.\n\nAs an author, your product reflects you. The quality of your writing reflects your talents. Always always always put your best foot forward in that respect. Don't rush. Good books will remain good. And a book is always new to someone who has never read it. Take your time. Finish your book. Be proud of your work. Worry about selling more books later.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n### What Genre Am I Even Writing?\n\nThis is another tough one.\n\nAs happens with the whole expectation of length thing, genres aren't the big bad wolf. They weren't devised by evil publishers trying to make everyone fit into neat little boxes. The purpose of a genre is just this --\n\nOh, you like that book with the kings and the swords and magic? Well you'll like this other book with more kings and some swords, less magic but more dragons!\n\nCategorizing books helps **readers** find books that are similar to the books they are interested in. \n\nThe long and the short of it here is write the book you want to write. When you're done, that's the time to figure out the genre, mostly by thinking about what other books are similar to your book (and hence, where it would go on a shelf). \n\nI won't lie. It helps to know the rules of different genres. And by rules, I mean expectations, just like our step example above. For instance, people who like space may not always really enjoy dragons. Or people who like dragons may not be expecting a long and focused romance plot with leather and lace. But do what you want, and worry about figuring out how to sell it later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n---\n\n## Hopefully You're Seeing The Trend\n\nSo what's the point of all this talk about expectations and hamster wheels? The point is, write your book in the best way you know how and worry about everything else later.\n\nSure, there are going to be decisions you make that will make your life hard. There are going to be expectations you may break by accident (although hopefully you've read enough in your genre to have an innate sense of these expectations without being explicitly told what they are). But your goal at this juncture is to step away from the wheel, and just write. Finish the book. Anything that you do can be undone. Any hole you dig can be patched later. Any plot point can be fitted, carved, worn, maneuvered into place. \n\nSo if you're struggling with these questions, take a moment to breathe in deeply, and get back to writing. :) We'll deal with the rest later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n---\n\n##This Week's Big Questions \n\n* Tell me if you've got any other concerns that keep cropping up as you write, and I'll do my best to get you off the hamster wheel and back to your book. :D",
