Don't let them have it.\"\u00a0\nWith that he turned and fled from the alley back into the mass of people.\u00a0\n\nJake came back to the present, the dark corridor squeezed the two occupants together uncomfortably.\u00a0\nBoth were breathing hard after the mad dash. \n\nJake tried to listen for any pursuing footfall but the beating of his heart throbbed in his ears.\u00a0\nSeconds seems like eons as they waited until they were sure it was ok to move.\u00a0\nThe man who had saved him grabbed him roughly at his shoulder, and pulled him along the creaky wooden floorboard to an equally dark sitting room.\u00a0\n\nThe dank smell and cold room seemed old, unused and uninviting.\u00a0\nIt was the first time Jake had been able to get a reasonably good look at his savior.\u00a0\nThe man was crouching down by a small cupboard searching within its depths for something.\u00a0\n\nHe seemed to be about the same height as Jake's 6 foot frame and in his mid 20's, although Jake was slimmer in the shoulders.\u00a0\nBlack sweat pants and a dark hoodie like he'd stepped out of the gym, only different was the strange-looking gun Jake could see nestled between the small of his back and his pants. \u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThe guy pulled out a small candle and a box of matches.\u00a0\n\n\"Have you seen the matrix\" he asked as he struck the match.\n\nWhat sort of question is that thought Jake.\nHe'd remembered his father allowing him to stay up late to watch it with him, whilst his mum was visiting his gran. \n\n\"Yeah I've seen it\" Jake replied.\u00a0\n\nSulphur followed the glow of the small candle. \nThe man's dark stumble and rounded face lit up. Deep-set eyes and short black hair complemented his rough appearance. \n\nJake glanced around at his surroundings.\nFaded 60's floral wall paper peeled from the top of the walls, mould and lichen climbed the dirty skirting boards. \nBroken floor board littered the room along with a scattering of rubbish like someone once took up residence only to leave shortly after.\u00a0\nThe windows was covered by so many years of dirt and grime that the street lights outside could hardly be seen.\u00a0\n\nThe room they were in was pretty bare, just the unit the man found the candle in, a small table that looked half broken and a mouldy chair. \nDull metal springs poked through the rips in its fabric.\u00a0\n\nThe man placed the candle on top the small table and turned to Jake.\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\"You take the blue pill, the story ends. You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe\".\u00a0\n\nThe man gestured with his hand in imitation of Morpheus from the film, only without the pills.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\"You take the red pill; you stay in Wonderland, and I'll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\"\n\nHe dropped his hand to his sides.\u00a0\n\n\"Good film, good quote and they almost got it right.\u00a0\nExcept there is no pill and there isn't a rabbit hole, well not one at least.\"\n\nThe man walked to the filthy window and smeared a small hole with his index finger and then peered out.\u00a0\n\n\"Hollywood loves to do that. They give you just enough information to start you hoping, just enough to make you believe in what if's; to have expectation's blossom in your heart, only for reality to hit you smack in the face as soon as you walk out of that cinema.\"\n\nHe wiped his hand on his pants and turned back to the candle light. The light danced under his chin giving his features a devilish look. \n\n\"I'm Sam by the way.\"\nThe man extended his hand to Jake.\u00a0\n\n\"Umm nice to meet you.\" Jake gripped the mans pre offered hand.\u00a0\n\n\"You see what the film did get right is that this world you live in is a prison, not just a prison for your mind but also a prison for your body.\u00a0\nAnd It's not a digital or virtual world where you get unplugged, like in the movies, and you wake up in Elysium, all rainbows, sunshine and lollipops.\"\n\nSam learned in close to Jake and searched his eyes, he turned back to the window all the while speaking over his shoulder.\u00a0\n\n\"No, is much more complicated than that.\"\n\n\"Sorry... err Sam, what are you on about?\"\n\n\"What I'm trying to say, is that's all changing now, well for you anyway; you no longer have to be content in this dimension.\" \n\n\"Dimension?\".\u00a0\n\nJake thought this guy was losing his marble pretty fast.\u00a0\nSam looked back and raised his eyebrows in search of a response, but none came. \u00a0\n\nJake inched to the door, maybe while Sam's back was turned he could slip out and be on his way.\u00a0\n\n\"I wouldn't do the Jake, I need to explain things first and then if you still want to go, I'll let you; I promise.\"\u00a0\n\nJake stopped, the board under his foot eased back with a tiny squeal. \nJake glimpse the gun at his back and thought If he want him to stay it was probably best.\u00a0\n\n\"The problem I'm faced with and the reason why I'm telling you this now, is that you've got mixed up in something much bigger than you could possibly imagine.\"\n\nSam shook his head and wondered back to the small candle too warm his hand over the tiny flame.\u00a0\n\nA police siren wailed outside. \nThe sound dying out as it moved away.\u00a0\n\nSilence again filled the broken down house.\u00a0\n\n\"I'm trying to tell you that whole new worlds exist Jake.\u00a0\nIn fact, I'm trying to tell you that there are an infinite number of worlds, a limitless number of dimensions, all accessible to you. You see the truth is your world, isn't ready to believe in the fact that there are others out there, your prime ministers, presidents, world leaders, whatever you want to call them. They're not ready to comprehend the implications of other worlds, can you imagine?\" He let the sentence hang. \n\nJake rubbed at his head and stared at Sam in disbelief.\u00a0\n\n\"I take it by your blank expression you're not following me?\" Sam smiled. \u00a0\n\n\"It's like this; I'm from....\"\n\nJake cut him off. \n\"Look mate, I'm not sure you've got the right guy here. This dimension stuff seems a little far-fetched to me. I'm just a normal guy with a normal job, living a normal life.\"\n\n\"Normal.\" Sam's laugher turned to spluttering.\u00a0\n\n\"Ok normal guy, why were Regulators after you then?\"\n\nJake thought back to the men who chased him to the tube station. \nThey looked like government type. Unmarked car, ear pieces.\u00a0\nJake had seen enough TV to know that if these types of people were coming for you, you ran.\n\n\"Regulators?\"\n\n\"Yeah Regulators, they're from the same place as me, I don't know why there want you, but it's definitely you they want. I've been watching them, watch you for a while now.\"\nJake shifted for the door again.\u00a0\n\n\"I'm not with them don't worry, quite the opposite actually.\" Sam spoke quickly.\n\n\"You may have no idea what's going on but I do and we're running out of time. So please just hear me out.\"\nSam's eyes pleaded with him as he turned away from the door again.\u00a0\n\nJake gestured for Sam to continue.\u00a0\n\"Thanks, ok well, \u00a0I'm from somewhere similar to here, similar to your earth but a different dimension. We call it Earth 9.\u00a0\nRemember the infinite dimensional stuff. Well, it's true. Only my world is a little different from yours.\"\n\nJake opened his mouth and then closed it again one finger held up in the air as he tried to comprehend what was being said. \u00a0\n\n\"Look It's like this, each dimension vibrates at a different frequency. Your earth one frequency, my earth another. Think of it like bubbles, one linked to another and then another linked to that, sometimes there're two or three bubbles joined together. \nYour bubble is the closest to my bubble in both location and vibration. It's like our sister earth, actually that not correct; it would be better described as a twin sister. Your world is the same as mine in all but one way. Keeping with me\".\u00a0\n\nJake nodded, something about what he was saying was starting to make sense.\u00a0\n\n\"We live in relative harmony with our animals and with the people of our world.\u00a0\nWe are thousands of years ahead of you in technology and understanding.\nSo naturally we evolved beyond the need for war. We no longer have famines, draught or needless killing.\u00a0\nOur ecosystem are stable and flourished to provide for us.\u00a0\nWe don't use what we don't need, and we replace what we use.\"\n\nSam patted some dust from his clothes absentmindedly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"We have a ruling body called 'the council', they keep the peace within my world, or the Regulators do that for them.\u00a0\nThat was who was chasing you.\nIf it wasn't for the council, we would have lived in a reality much like yours. They came to us from another earth when we were a young volatile race.\u00a0\nThey gave us their knowledge and technology, and over the millenniums helped to create our peaceful civilization.\nWell, it used to be peaceful.\"\n\n\"So what do I have to do with it then?\" Jake leaned against the wall, his expensive suit forgotten. \n\n\"A few years ago, a friend of mine invented a device that can be used to get you to any dimension at will. It somehow manipulated your vibrational energy and matches it to the dimension you want to visit. \nHe went missing a few weeks ago, along with the device. No contact, nothing, except a weird message saying he's in some sort of trouble and needs to find someone who could help.\"\n\n\"So what does that have to do with me Sam?\"\n\n\"I'll get to that Jake; I just need you to know a little bit about my world first, so you understand.\"\n\nJake nodded, and Sam continued. \n\n\"100 years ago, my people found a portal that they didn't know existed. They also found 12 individuals laying next to it.\u00a0\nThey were all dressed in sand coloured robes tied around the waist with strange fibres of blue. Their robes were stained, torn and scorched in places.\"\u00a0\n\n\"Skin like black glass showed through the holes, only its wasn't hard but soft and supple.\u00a0\nEach were over 7ft tall, a lot taller than our race, slimly\u00a0built with sharp facial features that reminded me of a hawk. And each had cold blue eyes.\"\n\n\"6 were clearly dead, green blood spilled from their heads making one big puddle in the dirt beneath them. It looked like they had been attacked, but by what or who we didn't know.\u00a0\nWhen we check them, 5 were still alive, but barely.\" \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"We slowly nursed them back to health, but they never spoke of what had happened to them, and like wise, my people never told them about how the came to be in our world.\"\n\n\"Who were they.\" Jake was surprised to be so interested in the story.\u00a0\n\nSam held up a finger.\u00a0\n\n\"The council decided to send a search party to their world to scout and report back. The scouts didn't find much at first, only a desolate place with a harsh environment.\"\n\nJake thought he heard a sound from outside but seeing as Sam didn't notice, he thought nothing of it. \n\n\"We nursed the survivors back to health, after a while the survivors started to refer to themselves as polluxians, but spoke little about their lives. We just assumed that polluxian was the name of their species.\u00a0\nEventually, we accepted that the polluxians loss of memories was effected by whatever accident had befouled their brothers.\"\n\n\"We came to trust them and seeing that their world was hostile, we offered them a place within our society\".\u00a0\n\nSam crouched down and started to doodle in the dirt of the floorboards.\u00a0\n\nJake thought he heard another knock from outside the front window. \n\n\"We didn't know that we were being lied to.\" Sam shook his head a took a deep breath. \u00a0\n\n\"Later reconnaissance showed that the polluxians world was dying, they had harvested all of their planet's resources, creating the barren waste the scouts had found. The few that were still there were at war with each other over the last of the resources.\u00a0\nThe council decided to keep the portals a secret from the polluxians. They weren't sure if they could be trusted with the knowledge that there were more worlds. They thought that the polluxians race might be wasteful by nature and wanted to prevent the fate of their home world from happening elsewhere.\"\n\n\"We now know that the polluxians had stumbled across the portal after an fight on a cliff face.\u00a0\nWe believe they didn't know about the Portals before and hoped that this one was the only one to our world, it must have been a shock for them. One minute they were falling, the next they were in our world. A world that was ripe in natural resources.\"\u00a0\n\n\"Like I said our technology, and knowledge was more advanced then than yours today. \nWe had long ago found the cure for diseases in cellular regeneration, but the byproduct of this was longevity. The implications of immortality were vast, and the council had to deliberate over the consequences.\"\n\nJake's\u00a0eyes went wide. \"Immorality, you telling me your an immortal?.\"\nSam barked a short laugh. \n\n\"You could say that but only in the sense that with our technology, I can live a long life not that I can't be killed.\"\n\n\"Anyway within our 15 city's over-population could have been a major problem. Concerned, the council decided to make all reproduction illegal without their express consent.\u00a0\nKids are a rare thing for us nowadays and are highly prized. It's almost a one out one in scenario. \u00a0\u00a0\nWhen you come of age you can decide to enter the re-Gen program. You don't have to but pretty much everyone does at least once.\u00a0\nIt's designed so you can elect to stay at any stage of your life, but you can never go back in age, only forward.\"\n\n\"How old are you then?\"\n\n\"Truly, I don't know. I woke up one day without any knowledge of my past. That was about 300 years ago.\" Sam stood and stretched out his legs.\u00a0\n\n\"Longevity has some remarkable benefits, and our greatest minds are still with us making further advances for our world's benefits. You could live for ten million years, but they can't do anything for your bones feeling old.\" Sam laugh again.\u00a0\n\nThe polluxians sought out a life for themselves away from the population of the 15 major cities.\u00a0\nWe had first thought that this was their way and left them to their own devices. They had little knowledge of technology themselves, so the council had little concern over them becoming a threat, and thought that in time their natural could be changed.\u00a0\nWhat the council didn't know was that they started to experiment with our technology.\u00a0\nSomehow the outcome of the experiment was twisted and warped. It would kill and destroy life rather than nurture and grow. Where ever their technology touched the environment and my people suffered.\u00a0\n\nOur world started to become infected by the polluxians labours.\u00a0\nThe council became aware and brought them in for questioning. The council cautioned them about their experiments and told them to live by our rules.\u00a0\nBut that just made them angry.\u00a0\n\nThey began to corrupt some of my people to they way of thinking and soon an uprising happened.\u00a0\n\nThe polluxians wanted to imprison my world; take control from the council and force the planet to its knees in servitude.\nThey wanted to take our technology for themselves and use immorality to become gods.\u00a0\nWe managed to fight the uprising and win. We captured them and took them thorough a portal to another world and from there we banished them through yet another that we long believed went to a void.\u00a0\nOnce through we collapsed the Portal and returned home.\u00a0\nWhat we didn't know was that they had managed to steal the very technology we fought to keep from\u00a0their hands, and later we also found that we had sent the polluxians through a portal that didn't function like the other, it was warped, twisted, we had no way of knowing where it went. All we did know was that we could have potential sent them to a less advanced race, with the gift of immortality.\u00a0\n\nAfter many years of searching the different planets we traced one to your world and found signs of the polluxians, once confirmed the council order that the portal from this earth be traced and a hunt begun.\u00a0\nAs a precaution they positioned a guardian at each portal off your world, to defend the it from the polluxians or to collapse it if was compromised.\u00a0\n\nThey've been manipulating your world from\u00a0the shadows. We recently found them and became aware of how the polluxians have been grooming your race for war.\u00a0\nThey have been pumping the media full of violence, hate crimes, racial abuse, natural disasters, political anarchy anything that filled your race with anger.\u00a0\nThey've being planning an attack on my world for a long time, and all they need is a army.\u00a0\nWe fear that the masses are one push away from self destruction.\u00a0\nOur agents have also confirmed that they have found a way to get to any world they want\"\nSam pulled his gun from his back and slid a finger up one side; a series of blue lights followed his finger up the length of the barrel. \n\n\"If the scouts are correct and they do have a device that can do that, well it's won't be long before my world and yours will be at war\".\u00a0\n\nSam put the gun back behind his back and looked up to meet Jake's eyes. \n\n\"Shit\" Jake slumped against the wall.\u00a0\n\n\"I think I know why they were after me.\" \n\nJake pulled a handkerchief from\u00a0his pocket and unwrapped it to show a weird long metallic object.\u00a0\n\nSam's eyes widen in shock, and a smile lit up his face. \n\"Well I'll be a monkey's uncle. You did manage to get the device to yourself, Damn; I heard you were good, but I didn't know you were that good.\"\u00a0 ",

There\u2019s a protagonist and an antagonist. A villain, and a hero. \n\nNow, this isn\u2019t always a Batman and Joker relationship. It can be as mundane as two kids fighting over the last piece of caked. But what is always present in these dilemmas are two characters holding different opinions on what is right. There's often fighting, and the loser faces consequences.\n\nSince this type of conflict is so common, you've probably already thought of a dozen man vs. man examples. Here are a few more: Sherlock vs. Moriarty, Harry Potter vs. Voldemort, Peter Pan and the lost boys against Captain Hook and his pirates, the list goes on. ;)\n\n---\n\nFor today\u2019s workshop, create a conflict between two characters. As usual 200 words minimum, 750 maximum. Please keep your replies SFW.\n\nYou can comment on some other's writing, telling them what you think. It's not required, but it\u2019s always exhilarating to get more than an upvote. \n\n**Optional Prompt:** ^In ^case ^you ^need ^help ^getting ^started.\n\n*Exhaustion filled your stomach, but you had to keep going.*\n \n**Things to consider**\n---\n\n* If you\u2019re using just two characters, try fleshing them both out. After all, the villain is the hero of their own story. \n\n* What is the conflict? Why are they so passionate? What are their motives? You can develop deep and complex motives, or you can choose to make it simple.\n\n* Will someone come out of this victorious? Or will this be resolved another day. In a lot of cases there isn't just one final confrontation, but a series of small skirmishes as well. Which are you choosing to focus on?\n\nHappy writing!\n\n***\n\n**Workshop Schedule** :\n\n*Workshop - Workshops created to help your abilities in certain areas.* \n\n*Workshop Q&amp;A - A knowledge sharing Q&amp;A session.*\n\n*Get to Know A Mod - Learn more about the mods who run this community.*\n\nIf you have any suggestions or questions, feel free to message the mod team or PM me (/u/madlabs67)\n\n\n\n",

            "selftext": "**Introduction:**\n-------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------\n\nWelcome! I am Maisie and hereby I open this week\u2019s *Invisible prompts*! Of course posted with permission from Lexi. ;) (She will forever be mentioned here, in this unchanging introduction)\n\nThe goal is to put unknown writers into the spotlight! This will be accomplished by scrolling through writingprompts and making a selection each week. I also only choose prompts that received less than twenty-five upvotes so it is more likely the prompt replies were seen by few eyes.\n\nI also take suggestions! For details see the bottom.\n\n**Personal notes:**\n-------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------\n\nHalfway through March already! Time really passes to fast. Now, quickly! Read through the prompt replies, leave comments, maybe write a reply yourself to the prompt, and then back to writing your first chapter for the ten million subscribers contest! Have fun. &lt;3\n\nWithout further delay\n\n**The invisible prompts**\n-------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------\n\n* [Prompt one](https://redd.it/5z96mo) [TT] A quest was given by the childless king to find his successor. It was open to any person from within the kingdom, regardless of age, race, gender and social status. The winner and new heir to the throne is female.\n\nPosted by u/Laytheron\n\nThis has an awesome tale, very well written, by u/mynameis4826 . \n\n---\n\n* [Prompt two](https://redd.it/5z8jtc) [WP] For the first time in history, a dragon is willing to attempt a trip to the moon.\n\nPosted by u/BookWyrm17\n\nSweet sweet dragons. &lt;3\n\n---\n\n* [Prompt three](https://redd.it/5z5k5f) [WP] In a world where everyone else is always happy and mental conditions are unknown, you suffer from clinical depression.\n\nPosted by u/uioor1\n\nAn interesting and challenging topic to write. :o With three stories. \n\n---\n\n* [Prompt four](https://redd.it/5z5jwx) [WP] For over a generation, a sentient AI has taken control of the world. Humanity, however, remains blissfully ignorant of this fact.\n\nPosted by u/Yourstruly75\n\nWith a funny and short response from u/Cheeseman06 . :)\n\n---\n\n* [Prompt five](https://redd.it/5z5nx1) [CW] A man comes into town, dragging a coffin behind him.\n\nPosted by u/ASharedNarrative\n\nSuch a strange narrative. x) Enjoyable replies to read though since they have to stay relatively realistic. x)\n\n---\n\n* [Prompt six](https://redd.it/5yqs71) [IP] Amorphous\n\nPosted by u/Syraphia\n\nAnother beautiful image chosen by the Goddess of WP. :)\n\n---\n\n* [Prompt seven](https://redd.it/5z54is) [WP] Kitten attacks become acute problem.\n\nPosted by u/fringly\n\nNo one can resist kittens. &lt;3\n\n**Do you have a suggestion?!**\n-------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------\n\nYes, a starship troopers inspired line. ;) You can pm me any prompt you like as long they fulfill the following criteria:\n\n* The prompt was posted within two weeks before the invisible prompts was posted. I post this each Tuesday so take a look at the date for the upcoming Tuesday to determine if the prompt was posted in the right timeframe. Of course being a few hours over time is not a problem. \n\n* The prompt itself received only 25 or less upvotes. \n\n* The prompt must have one reply in it. The goal is after all to showcase writers. :)\n\n-------------------------------\n\n[The invisible prompts from 07-March-2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5xzhzq/ot_the_invisible_prompts/)\n\n[The invisible prompts from 21-March-2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/60mszx/ot_the_invisible_prompts/)",

            "selftext": "Dust hissed through the dry and dying plant beside him, the ground stirred up by the wind temporarily surging through the abandoned alleyway. Behind him through a gap in two buildings the desert of the frontier stretched to the horizon, the squat ridge of the crater barely visible beyond it.\n\nJohn wrapped his heavy woollen cloak around him and grimaced feeling dust settle inside the folds. If grit built up again in his water sequencer, he was never going to hear the end of it from Charlie.\n\nSafe water at one time was plentiful, although growing increasingly less so by the time this settlement deployed. The buildings at the crater's edge now ancient and decrepit were the remnants of its original extent.\n\nFaint coughing behind a doorway ahead brought him around. Crouching beside a number of larger crates, the shadows deeper here, the working of an old latch heralded a sudden blast of noise in the alleyway.\n\nA cat darted out from the direction of the sound, pausing momentarily at the sight of him before moving on.\n\n\"Quieten those prisoners down,\" said a voice John recognised as the town's sheriff.\n\nThe alleyway fell quiet once more as the latch was set back in place, only the strike and sudden flare of a match breaking the silence, followed by the sound of rifling through  pockets of a jacket.\n\nJohn crouched motionless in the shadows. He could only wait and hope as the pounding of his heart in his ears grew louder, that the sheriff did not notice his presence.\n\nTurning toward the desert the man stepped beside the crate John hid behind, trying again to light his cigarette. Cupping the match from another stifling breeze, the glow bloomed across the sheriff's shadowed face.\n\nJohn started as the match was flicked toward him, lighting up his darkened form, he was no longer out of sight. Diving at the sheriff as the man too realised what it was he was seeing, John struck the others hand from the sidearm at his hip. Pinning the man against the wall with the back of his arm and calmly bringing his own revolver to the sheriff's temple. The sheriff raised his hands.\n\n\"Ten million credits,\" said John. \"That's what you've cost me.\"\n\n\"Who\u2013\" began the sheriff.\n\n\"That's not the worst of it,\" said John, growling in hushed tones. \"You cost me a brother,\"\n\nThe sheriff's eyes widening as John began pushing the revolver into the man's temple reaching to pull down the hammer, a moment passed full of horror, then the man's eyes relaxed, quickly flicking to the side. The noise in the alley had grown without John noticing.\n\nHe hadn't heard the latch, pain blossomed on the back of his head making him unsteady. He hadn't heard the boots of the man behind him either. The dust and grit was tasteless in his mouth as he hit the ground.\n\nCharlie was going to kill him.\n\n---\n\nJohn groaned. He came to, face down amongst the noise of the lockup. All he could smell was piss and sweat. It clung heavily around him and the other inhabitants of the cell.\n\n\"Check this out sheriff,\" said a man who must have been the deputy. \"He's got one of those fancy water purifiers.\"\n\nThe deputy was holding up the harness he had been wearing beneath his clothes. They had been thorough, far more so than the bandits who been robbing caravans \u2013 including his own \u2013 on their way to New Windermere.\n\n\"That's a water sequencer,  Ways issue,\" said the sheriff. \"You don't see many other than off-worlders with equipment like that.\"\n\nThe deputy stormed over to the front of the cell. \"Who'd you kill for this convict,\" he shouted.\n\n\"Bill, he's not a convict until he's tried and then convicted,\" said the sheriff. \"We've been over this,\"\n\n\"Whatever sheriff,\" responded Bill the deputy. \"I don't see a name tag.\"\n\nThe sheriff shook his head, going back to cleaning the revolver at his desk.\n\nJohn pulled himself into a low crouch and shuffled toward the end of the nearest bench in one corner of the room.\n\n\"Don't I recognise you from somewhere brother?\" said a voice from his right.\n\nJohn, shaking his head leaned forward trying to identify the speaker amongst the others in the rows of grizzled prisoners.\n\n\"I do, don't I,\" the voice said again. \"Hey, Joe. Remember that last guy we held up?\"\n\nThe man speaking pointed toward him with an outstretched hand. A figure roused from across the cell. Squinting slowly, a monotone pondering groan emanating from his chest.\n\n\"Looks like a nobody to me, that last guy had some fight in him,\" said the still squinting man. \"Didn't we kill him?\"\n\n\"Naw,\" said the first voice. \"June took a shine to this guy. Isn't that right Junie?\" raising his voice to a shout, he turned toward the cell's bars.\n\n\"Quiet Bo,\" said a confident feminine voice from somewhere outside of the cell John sat in. \"You know I'm trying to rest for the ride out of here. I do hate the desert.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" said the sheriff loudly interrupting the exchange. \"Sorry miss, the only place you're headed is the jail in Liverpool. If you're really lucky, we'll waste a bullet on you like the rest of your friends here.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure sheriff,\" said Bo quietly.\n\n\"What was that convict?\" said the deputy, still standing by the cells. He looked back to the sheriff for approval who nodded.\n\nA single shot rang out, muffled by the walls of the building. Others followed quickly in pairs and then sounds of havoc erupted like the crackling of wild embers in a roaring fire.\n\nThe deputy darted backward from the cells rushing to one side of the window, his sidearm drawn.\n\nJohn felt the atmosphere in the room change, there was no more chatter, the men around him sat up \u2013 alert. The sheriff and his deputy peered through the shuttered windows looking toward the sound of gunfire across town.\n\n\"Get on the wire,\" said the sheriff. \"Find out what's going on at the station.\"\n\nThe deputy darted over to an ageing panel on one wall.\n\n\"This is Lockup, calling Station,\" said the deputy into the receiver. \"What's your status?\"\n\nOnly static followed, a few of the men around John chuckled quietly.\n\n\"Calling station. Respond!\" repeated the deputy. \"Sheriff, I don't\u2013\"\n\n\"Lockup, this is the Mayor's office,\" said a strained voice. \"They're right on top of you.\"\n\nRumbling hooves striking the street outside followed the statement.\n\n\"Sheriff,\" said the deputy turning back toward the room. \"What's the plan?\"\n\nThe door to the alleyway by the cells stood open, the sheriff was gone. Laughs sounded from the cells as the deputy's face changed.\n\n\"Oh man...\" was all he said as the man rushed toward the open alley door. The heavy reinforced door to the lockup behind him burst open and the crack of a shot filled the room, ejecting the deputy into the alleyway.\n\nJohn watched as three men piled into the room and another from the alleyway door, grinning as he stepped over the corpse of the deputy.\n\n\"No sheriff?\" said the grinning man. \"I thought we'd catch him here this time.\"\n\n\"Not today,\" said Bo, from his seat in the cell. \"He scarpered as soon as that kid got on the wire.\"\n\n\"You look cosy in there brother,\" said the man, a grin still stuck across his face.\n\n\"Open the cell Marcus,\" said Bo in deadened tones. \"You better hope the deputy has the keys, or you'll be searching for that sheriff until the cavalry arrive.\"\n\n\"I could just leave you in here,\" said Marcus. \"To rot, until the next time we roll into town.\"\n\n\"Oh stop teasing, Marcus,\" said June from the opposite cell. \"Get us out of here.\"\n\n\"Anything for you June,\" said Marcus, reaching into a pocket he pulled out a ring of keys. \"Looks like I had the keys. Strange that.\"\n\nJohn hadn't even seen the man search the deputy let alone lift the keys off him. What was going on here? The cell buzzed with excitement. However, one man amongst them had a look for terror on his face. Studying him for a moment, the man met his eyes, they widened at the attention and he quickly looked back at his feet.\n\n\"Better get to recruiting,\" Bo said to the cell at large. He had noticed the exchange.\n\n\"You there,\" he said gesturing to the terrified man. \"What are you in for?\"\n\nThe man shrunk further still into his own shoulders.\n\n\"The sheriff,\" he said. \"He told me to sober me up.\"\n\n\"Sober up?\" asked Bo. \"Who cares if a man gets a little drunk. Do we care fellas?\"\n\nThere was a rowdy chorus of denials.\n\n\"What's your profession?\" said Bo.\n\n\"I... I'm a carpenter,\"\n\n\"You work wonders with your hands all day, helping the town prosper and grow,\" said Bo. \"Then they throw you in here over a little drink. Doesn't seem fair does it lads?\"\n\n\"Not fair at all,\" spoke up one of the men in slow solemn tones. The others nodding quietly in agreement.\n\n\"You know,\" said Bo. He stood up and sat next to the man, putting an arm around his shoulder and smiling as he did so. He ignored the man's flinch at the contact.\n\n\"We appreciate a man of talent, there's a lot of work for one, and a lot of opportunity.\"\n\nThe man stayed silent, still staring at the sodden floor.\n\n\"We take all the drinking buddies we can get too,\" said Bo nudging the man with his elbow and laughing. \"What do you say, join us?\"\n\nThe man stayed silent, and then looked up at John. Bo followed his gaze.\n\n\"Oh you've heard,\" said Bo. \"You're right. We only take one from a cell. We should give this guy a chance too.\"\n\nJohn stared Bo in the face. The expression of the carpenter by his side became pleading.\n\n\"So,\" began Bo. \"Attempted murder of the sheriff.\"\n\n\"I never said I wanted to murder him,\" said John. \"Why would I join a group who already robbed me?\"\n\n\"So you want to die here?\" said Bo, a strange smile on his face. \"Let's put our previous history behind us, and forge a new future.\"\n\n\"I have my own plans while I'm here,\" said John. The clink and rattle of locks disengaging sounded as they opened the cell behind him.\n\n\"Not planning on staying?\" said Bo. \"Everybody says that at the frontier. Nobody leaves.\"\n\n\"Maybe not,\" said John. \"But, I intend to finish what I started.\"\n\n\"Shame,\" said Bo. \"Great shame.\"\n\nJohn braced himself for the fight he expected to come.\n\n\"Who are these guys?\" said Marcus as he strolled into the cell.\n\n\"New carpenter,\" said Bo, pointing to the man.  Then at John. \"Some guy we robbed once, and he's here for attempted murder of the sheriff.\"\n\n\"The sheriff?\" said Marcus. \"Ha, I like him already.\"\n\nIn a swift and fluid motion Marcus pulled the weapon from his hip and shot the carpenter where he still sat.\n\n\"How does a carpenter end up in a cell anyway?\" said Marcus, he sniggered at the now silent room.\n\n\"You idiot,\" said Bo. \"That man was going to join us. We need more skilled hands.\"\n\n\"That guy,\" said Marcus gesturing with this revolver toward the body of the man. \"Over that guy?\" he continued gesturing to John.\n\n\"You're the idiot,\" said Marcus. \"Didn't June take a liking to him? I'm not touching him.\"\n\n\"That man doesn't *want* to join us,\" said Bo raising his voice.\n\n\"Bo, we need killers,\" said Marcus. \"You seem to forget that. Besides, who's going to give this guy a choice?\"\n\n\"Gar,\" said Marcus calling behind him. \"Got that rope we picked up at that farm on the way in?\"\n\n\"Yes boss,\" responded one of the men who had entered earlier. He began to riffle through his pack.\n\n\"That was a nice shot by the way,\" he said winking to John. \"The deputy I mean. Just as he was escaping.\"\n\n\"Thanks boss,\" Gar said as he hastily attempted to wind up the rope he was extricating from the contents of the pack.\n\n\"Try not to hog all the fun next time,\" said Marcus snatching the bundle of rope from his hands. \"He would have run right into my waiting hands,\" here tie up this friend to be. Find him a horse and stick him on it.\n\nJohn had watched the exchange in silence. Looking from Bo, to Marcus. He turned to the former.\n\n\"Better with you, than dead?\" said John.\n\nBo hesitated for a moment. \"Now you're getting it.\" he said. Distrust plain across face.\n\n\"See,\" said Marcus grinning and slapping John on the back. \"Everyone wants to join the club. But, too bad. We're still tying you up.\"\n\n\"Boss, boss,\" said a man crashing through the door. He ran up to June, panting for air.\n\nJohn raised his eyebrows as he looked between the two men in front of him. They simply watched. Gar continued his work restraining him, and the new recruit had begun to lose feeling in his hands.\n\nThe conversation was brief and the man darted back outside.\n\n\"Bo. Marcus,\" said June. \"Playtime is over. Gather the crew, let's get out here. The cavalry just arrived.\"\n\n\"Come on lads,\" said Bo. \"Find yourselves horses, burn what you can. Maybe they'll stop to help.\"\n\n\"Ha, no chance of that,\" said Marcus. \"Cavalry are as heartless as our Junie here.\"\n\n\"Go, both of you,\" said June. Tearing a revolver out of one of the men's waiting hands, she rushed out of the room at the head of her own group.\n\n\"So,\" said John. \"She's the boss?\"\n\n\"It sure looks that way,\" said Bo. \"I better do what I'm told.\"\n\nBo grabbed him by the shoulder, practically dragging him toward the alley door. Men rushed passed, jostling the two of them. John unsteady and bound, and constantly trying to tear away from them was soon strapped over the back of a horse, tied down uncomfortably tight.\n\n\"At least I won't fall off,\" he said aloud muffled against his restraints.\n\n\"You won't?\" said Bo who had the leading reins of John's horse in one hand. \"I'm expecting you to fall off at least once. Just please not in this first dash. It would be inconvenient.\"\n\nAs he finished the roar of thrusters filled John's ears. Straining he tried to look toward the sky to what he knew was inevitable.\n\n\"Yup,\" said Bo. \"If you're unlucky you're dead. If you fall behind you're dead.\"\n\nThe repeated clack of high velocity cannons drilling into the ground sounded from somewhere nearby in another alleyway.\n\n\"Bo,\" said Marcus following up from behind. \"We're going to get pinned down if any more of these ships turn up. Let's make a run for it.\"\n\n\"Best of luck,\" shouted Bo and he set his horse down the alleyway and out into the open, leading John's along at a gallop.\n\nImmediately the sound of a ship grew deafening as one of the Calvary's land defence units darted in their direction. The rumble of hooves on the desert grew as June's crew \u2013 whoever they were \u2013 fled the town for the desert. Fires had sprouted back at the town, now visible over the buildings at its edge. At the sight the ships in pursuit swung back around and headed back to town.\n\n\"Woo,\" shouted Bo. \"I told you didn't I. Light a few fires and we would be fine.\"\n\n\"You got lucky,\" said Marcus. \"These crews must be new, or soft. Don't expect it to happen again. Especially once they find the bodies.\"\n\nShouts rose behind them, more ships \u2013 only now dots on the horizon \u2013 moved to intercept the riders.\n\n\"Better not fall behind recruit,\" Bo said to John. \"We've covered the luck. Now you just need to keep up.\"\n\nJohn growled something incoherent.\n\n\"Relax,\" said Bo. \"What can go wrong? You're an outlaw now.\"",
