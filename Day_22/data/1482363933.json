That's what he called it.\n \n\"You see, Mr. Harrison, the most anyone has ever tried to do is to attack the cells a bit at a time.  Bit by bit, you get rid of a few cells here and there and hope you can get them all in time.  And often, we lose.  Because as we know too well, cancer spreads.  And as it spreads it attacks those cells that it comes across, infecting them.  We end up running a losing race, always a few steps behind.\n \n\"But what if we could win that race right out of the gate?  If we could bring those aberrant cells to us, gather them in one portion of the body, we could remove them all at once!  And I, after years of experimentation, have created a compound that will allow us to do just that.  It contains a synthetic strain of protein that, in all of our tests, has proven more appetizing to cancer cells than the normal body tissue around it.  They flock to the site of injection, and we tag them with a black dye so we can easily extract them all as a single mass.  Well, that's the idea anyway.  Now all that's left, with your permission, is to run a full-scale trial...\"\n \nWith a gleam in his eye, the doctor had pushed the form across his desk at me.  I was more than a little intrigued.  And being terminal, I had nothing to lose.  So I signed it and pushed it back.  And when the day came, I arrived at the complex and was led to a stark-white room where the surgical team was waiting.\n \nThe walls aren't white anymore.\n \nThat's the first thing I notice when I open my eyes.  The once pristine tiles surrounding me are splashed with streaks of red.  As I raise myself up off the table I quickly begin to see why.  The five men and women who I had met so briefly before going to sleep are strewn around the floor, very obviously dead.  I dare not approach them, but I can see the tears in their clothes.  The gaping wounds, the blisters slowly beginning to form.  The sharp surgical tool clenched tightly in each corpse\u2019s fist.\n \nAs the shock wears off a thought hits me.  Whoever did this to them could still be in the building.  Could still be in this room!  Quickly wrapping the gown around me, I turn to leave this gallery of death behind.\n \nA sharp pain in the sole of my foot rips a howl of pain from my throat. I lift it to see my own blood beginning to ooze around a shard of glass.  Gingerly, I pluck it from the skin and set it on a metal counter.  Looking back to the floor I find the remains of a large specimen jar shattered in front of me.  Bending, I see the pieces are streaked with some sort of black slime.  I raise a hand to my side and feel the stitches etched into my flesh.  What do you know, they actually did it!  I frown.  Then where was the...\n \nI freeze as my eyes continue across the floor and settle on the base of the wall in front of me.  There, sending a spiderweb of cracks out to the surrounding tiles, is a gaping hole about the size of a small dog.  And smeared around the perimeter of the hole is a now-familiar black slime.  I slump against the cool metal of the counter as the distant screams begin.\n \nI think it's safe to say that I've won my battle with cancer.  Now, by God, I just hope we can survive the war...\n\n*****\n\n[Thy fate is truly terrible...](https://www.reddit.com/r/BensTerribleFate/)",

As the cards landed in front of us, Simon knelt down by my side, rubbing the inside of my arm as if he were trying to seduce me. From my peripheral, I could see him constantly switch his stare between my arm and his syringe. Already his breathing was rapid, going in and out in exuberantly.\n\nI looked across the table, and Melvin gave me a slow nod. He was first to act, piling on chips in an orderly fashion and then pushing them into the middle of the table. I turned around and faced Clarence and Baozhai. I jerked my head in the direction of the chips I had just received, and they both rushed to place my chips next to Melvin\u2019s. Once all of my chips were in the middle, I looked to Melvin once more.\n\n\u201cDo you want my doctor to be ready to slice off my finger?\u201d Melvin was resting his chin in an open palm. I wondered why he would offer to do this, and felt my face contort to reflect that. Melvin huffed quietly and motioned to a man behind him. \n\nThe man wore slacks and a polo, and came to the table with a pair of shears. Melvin looked in my direction once more.\n\n\u201cAny preference for which finger I lose?\u201d The sincerity in his voice caught me by surprise, and I let out an awkward sigh.\n\n\u201cUh, not really?\u201d I started. \u201cJust, uh, whichever one isn\u2019t your dominant hand I guess.\u201d\n\nMelvin offered his left hand to the doctor, who promptly opened the blades of the shears and rested Melvin\u2019s pinky between them. Melvin then shifted slightly to his left and faced the dealer.\n\n\u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nWhat was Melvin playing at? Did he suddenly feel bad about taking the bet? Did he think I\u2019d at least be somewhat content in dying if I saw his readiness to accept a missing digit? I pondered what his game was, but seeing no possible way for the gesture to change the cards I concluded that he must have done it out of some weak sense of sympathy for me. Maybe he felt really bad about accepting my bet after all?\n\nBefore he laid down the flop, the dealer turned to me with raised eyebrows. I worked against Simon\u2019s grip to wave him on, managing to barely shake my wrist in his direction.\n\n\u201cHey, Hernandez!\u201d Simon shouted. I felt the metal point of the syringe graze my skin, and I gasped loudly, flinching a little bit. Simon tightened his grip on my arm, turning a pair of malevolent eyes away from the dealer to look at me.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s not enough in the needle to kill you now! It\u2019ll only kill you if I plunge the fluid into you!\u201d Simon quickly turned his attention back to the dealer. \u201cJust go ahead and lay down all the cards. There\u2019s not going to be any more betting sessions for this round.\u201d\n\nThe dealer nodded and reached into the deck, grabbing the first card. I began to feel a creeping dread crawl up my spine with icy fingers. While I was confident in my bet, the fear of death loomed over me like an angry storm cloud. As it stood, I had about a fifty-fifty chance of leaving this mortal coil in one of the most painful ways imaginable. As the dealer set down the cards in rapid succession, I realized that I would have to accept my death now before I succumbed to the mindless throes I was to endure. \n\nFirst card: King of Spades.\n\nI\u2019m ten years old, and I\u2019m sitting across from Ronnie on Lake Anna. I cast my line in for the billionth time that day, complaining to Ronnie about how boring I thought fishing was. Ronnie only laughs, and tells me to give it a few more minutes. As soon as the words leave his mouth, I feel an incredible tug on my line, and I struggle to yank my rod and reel in the fish at the same time. Ronnie quickly shuffles behind me, placing his hands over mine and guiding me, offering his strength to bring in the fish. My line grows closer to our boat, and a massive fish breaks through the water. We bring the flopping mass into our boat, and both Ronnie and I are laughing our asses off as we look at the great striped bass I pulled in.\n\nSecond card: seven of Diamonds.\n\nI\u2019m twenty-three, and my family and Ana\u2019s are celebrating our collective graduations a few weeks late. Stress is weighing me down greatly, as I had taken the bar exam earlier than most students have, and the possibility of passing the first time with as little time as I had to study is slim. Ana consoles me as best as she can, and I try my best to enjoy the party. Suddenly, I hear a familiar whoop from the front of my house. Members of the Sapp and Korhonen families come around from the back to see my uncle Ronnie jumping like a madman with an open envelope and a piece of paper in his hands. He dashes toward me at a pace that I could never imagine a portly man like him to be capable of. His speech is incoherent, and elects to explain things to me by shoving the paper in my face. Soon, I too am struggling to speak, and I feel all stress dissipate in an instant. I passed the bar: I was a lawyer.\n\nThird card: Ace of Spades.\n\nI\u2019m twenty-four, and Ana and I have stopped at a desolate gas station after seeing her art being featured in a prestigious gallery. With her on my arm, I hand the clerk twenty to go toward pump two, but find my feet cemented in place. A voice in my head compels me to stay, and I find myself staring at the lottery display. I hand the clerk a five and ask for the number twenty-one. Ana holds me, concern etched deeply into her face. I pull out my keys and scratch the ticket right there on the counter. I\u2019m breathless as the latex reveals one of four top prizes are mine. Ana squeals in delight and jumps up and down in manic delight. I pick her up and spin her around, feeling my heart synchronize with hers.  \n\nFourth card: Queen of Spades.\nI\u2019m twenty-five, and I\u2019m beaming as I talk to both local and national news networks. I\u2019m gripping Ana\u2019s hand with such force that I\u2019m surprised she\u2019s still smiling. I take my time explaining how fortunate I am that things worked out, and start to list the people I found responsible for my success in such a difficult case. Just beyond the flashbulbs and lights of various news crews, I see the families of the deceased children continuing to cry their tears of joy. Had Ana not been holding my hand, I might have joined them. I then find myself thanking Ana at length for her help in this case, and before long she\u2019s blushing profusely. I bring her in closely for a kiss, and our lips meet for a long time, serenaded by a chorus of clicking shutters. I curse at myself for not having a ring for this occasion, and promise myself to make sure I don\u2019t miss the opportunity to propose to Ana again. \n\nFifth card: two of Hearts.\n\nFour months ago, I\u2019m visiting a jeweler, thinking about what ring would look best on Ana\u2019s finger. For a moment, money is no object, and nothing is too good for my Ana. But then, an old itch resurfaces. Why should I buy her one of these rings when I could buy her something ten times better with another lottery win? Or betting on the winning horse at the local track? Or playing the right fool at cards? I leave the place with a grin on my face that I\u2019m sure would sicken anyone who saw it.\n\nMy brief trip through the highs of my life culminated in an overpowering feeling of self-loathing. I had everything I could have ever wanted, but for some reason, that wasn\u2019t enough. I had thrown everything away for the chance to make more money, something I didn\u2019t need. Once again, I felt my hatred for my actions mix with my weakening courage, replicating the emotions I had when I first stood outside the Virginia State Lottery Headquarters. Like then, I find myself reaching for my chest, hoping to touch the tie Ana had made for me. Simon\u2019s restraint on me held fast, but it didn\u2019t matter anyway: I was still sitting in my tank top. Wherever my tie was, I wasn\u2019t going to be able to feel it before I died. I felt a few tears fall out of my eyes, and I futilely attempted to sniffle away my cries. Simon cackled once more, dragging the edge of the needle against my skin.\n\n\u201cCome on!\u201d He shouted quickly, leaning in closely once more. \u201cI\u2019ll give you until you flip your cards to kill you. I won\u2019t even inject it until you reveal your hand!\u201d\n\nI ignored Simon\u2019s words for a moment, and tried my best to picture the stitched words in my mind.\n\n*Made with love for Richard by Ana*\n\n\u201cDo it!\u201d Simon said again, this time clacking his teeth with every syllable. The needle bounced precariously against my skin, Simon\u2019s nervous energy threatening to penetrate my skin. I looked to Melvin, who once again nodded slowly. I returned the gesture, and bit the inside of my cheeks.  \n\nBoth Melvin and I reached for our cards. What was once creeping uncertainty had become all-consuming dread. I was shaking violently, but deep, quick breaths and the ongoing stream of tears down my face insured that my hand stayed steady. My hands touched the cards. Once more, my life flashed before my eyes: the best parts of my existence condensed themselves into microseconds. \n\nI see the back of some girl\u2019s head as I sit in Mr. O\u2019Mahoney\u2019s 4th grade class: thin steaks of brown hidden amongst a sea of shocking, almost white blonde. I\u2019m called to the front to be belittled for my failure to pay attention, but use the chance to look at her face. I feel myself smile as the teacher asks me if I think what he said was funny, but I\u2019m too immersed in this pretty girl to respond properly.\n\nI smell a mix of pineapple and other fruit juices from my drink as I watch with the same girl dance with Charley Nichols at the 8th grade Back to School Bash. They dance at arm\u2019s length, stepping out of tune with the music that I can\u2019t hear for the pounding in my ears, but they\u2019re both smiling these goofy smiles. Despite seeing her with someone else, I\u2019m still madly in love with the girl, while I seethe at the sight of Charley\u2019s smile. I dream of being in her arms, smiling with her, and stepping out of tune with the music as I leave without fanfare.\n\nI taste peppermint as the same girl brings her lips to mine at Jessica Beltran\u2019s Senior Christmas party. I had been unaware moments before, but apparently I had been drinking by myself under the mistletoe. The girl in question had apparently been crushing on me for years, and planned this whole thing out. She even got the peppermint lip gloss for me, the result of one of my friends telling her it was one of my favorite flavors. She pulls away and I lick my lips, savoring the flavor on the off chance I\u2019d never taste it again, a measure proven pointless only seconds later when she dives right back into my face with a ravenous smile.\n\nI feel my right shoulder grow wet as she cries her eyes out onto my shirt. I have my arms wrapped tightly around her as she mourns the passing of her grandmother, who I wouldn\u2019t soon forget for constantly telling me I \u201cwas the best boy she had ever shown off to the family.\u201d She speaks in jumbled sentences and through loud sobs, and I remain silent, rubbing her back and letting her cry for as long as she needs to. \n\nI hear Billy Corgan\u2019s throaty whispers transform into passionate cries as my heart slows down to an audible crawl. This girl is close to me, not the way she was with Charley Nichols, but truly close, so close for a dance that bystanders might mistake our movements for a prolonged hug. But passerby are hardly a risk since we\u2019re in a remote place that we made special many years ago when I finally asked her out officially. For the longest time, I had considered being this close to her mere fantasy, a dream that would remain just that, and yet here I was, holding her and swaying slowly to a song we had deemed long ago as our song. She pulls away as the music slows, and Corgan says \u201cTonight\u201d one last time as our lips meet, the kiss maintained long into the silence that followed.\n\nAna, I love you so, so much.\n\n---\n\nThe next part is going to take a little bit (probably? I could feasibly do it quicker based on my inconsistent posting history) for two reasons: I'm struggling to decide how the next part unfolds and school starts back for me today. For the first thing, I'm going to do my damnedest to pick one to post first, then I'll post the alternative part a little while after. As for school, it'll all depend on what my workload is like. Either way, I'm hoping to finish this story in the next week or two, so keep checking for new parts! Thanks as always for reading, and come back later for Part [18](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5p5u04/cc_there_is_a_strange_lottery_that_picks_a_random/) (uh, both parts?)!\n\nUPDATE: Due to a plot hole I created, there will now only be ONE part 18. Fortunately, this plot hole no longer has bearing on the overall story. Apologies to those of you who were looking forward to an alternate ending.",

My breathing reduced to a lethargic pace. The silence helped me keep track of my breaths, and I made sure I was getting plenty of oxygen. After all the last thing I needed to do was pass out.\n\nClarence was the first to speak.\n\n\u201cRichard, I know you\u2019re desperate\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you?!\u201d Baozhai cut him off with a powerful shout. \u201cYou have no right to foolishly gamble your life away!\u201d\n\nI slowly turned to face her.\n\n\u201cI have every right to.\u201d\n\n\u201cRichard, this is unnecessary! I can\u2019t believe-\u201c\n\n\u201cBelieve that this is the only way for me to win?\u201d I started. \u201cBelieve that I\u2019m willing to put my life on the line for all of this? Yeah, I can barely believe it either, but there\u2019s no other way for me to have a chance at winning this thing with so little time left.\u201d\n\nBaozhai\u2019s face fell, and she looked to the floor, gritting her teeth. Clarence came to my left side, grabbing my chin to turn my face to his.\n\n\u201cRichard, there is no need to do this. Besides, I\u2019m not going to-\u201c\n\n\u201cHold on.\u201d Clarence and I looked across the table to see Melvin thoughtfully rub his chin with a shaky hand. \u201cYou mean you\u2019re just betting your life, and I\u2019m just betting my pinky? That doesn\u2019t sound like much of a wager to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay then.\u201d I retorted quickly. My face turned to face Melvin suddenly, causing Clarence\u2019s grip to loosen. \u201cIn addition to that, we\u2019ll each gamble $20,000. But here\u2019s the deal. Are you listening?\u201d\n\nMelvin nodded slowly, his hold on his chin tightening by the second.\n\n\u201cIf I win, I get your pinky. It\u2019s mine to keep to do with as I please. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d Melvin let go of his chin and leaned forward. \u201cI don\u2019t know man. I\u2019d rather see my hand first-\u201c\n\n\u201cSorry, but that\u2019s not how this next bet is going to go.\u201d I slammed my hand into the table. \u201cIf you accept my bet, then the next game will begin with both of us getting our cards facedown. We won\u2019t look at them at all until after the dealer has presented the river. Once the river is out, we\u2019ll flip our cards over, and whoever has the stronger hand wins.\u201d\n\n\u201cWoah, hold on.\u201d Melvin held his hand up, shaking his head from side to side. \u201cYou mean I don\u2019t get to look at my hand until *after* the river?\u201d \n\nI nodded rapidly.\n\n\u201cOnly after the river has hit the table do we present our hand.\u201d\n\nMelvin rubbed his chin again, looking to his right, deep in thought. After a moment, he shook his head \u2018no\u2019.\n\n\u201cI already have the lead, there\u2019s no reason for me to-\u201c\n\n\u201cOh, come on, I didn\u2019t think you were *that* big of a pussy!\u201d\n\nSure enough, my words intended target came out of the woodwork to offer his two cents. Simon stepped over to Melvin, hands in his pockets and a massive grin on his face.\n\n\u201cCome on, dude!\u201d He slapped Melvin\u2019s back hard enough to make a huge slap sound throughout the room. I saw Melvin lean forward and wince. Simon leaned down and began to talk to Melvin, resting his chin on the backside of his hands. \u201cI thought you were the Shark of the Silver Strip! And to see you back down from a big bet like this is just fucking disappointing!\u201d\n\nMelvin was clearly taken aback by Simon\u2019s statement, but steeled himself and began to rebut his argument. \n\n\u201cSimon, give me a break. I\u2019m way ahead of this guy, and I have no reason to go balls to the walls against him. Even if I\u2019m only offering less than half my pot and my pinky in exchange for his great wager, I\u2019m not guaranteed a win here. I have nothing to gain.\u201d\n\nSimon huffed through his nose. Rage flashed on his face. As I had expected, being denied the right to see someone die was a unique, excruciating kind of pain for him. Melvin recoiled at the sight of Simon\u2019s rage. But then Simon\u2019s expression softened into a small smile.\n\n\u201cThen allow me to offer you something to gain here, Melvin.\u201d He stood up and got behind Melvin, kneading his hands into his shoulders before sticking his head just above Melvin\u2019s left shoulder. Melvin looked nervously at Simon as he began to talk.\n\n\u201cIf you take this insect\u2019s bet and beat him, I\u2019ll give you the one thing that the money you\u2019ll receive can\u2019t quite get you: a perfectly clean academic record.\u201d\n\nMelvin scoffed and rolled his eyes.\n\n\u201cPlease, dude, you can\u2019t possibly convince me that I can\u2019t bribe my own teachers and have them cook the books in my favor?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, on the contrary.\u201d Simon lifted his hand off of Melvin\u2019s left shoulder for a moment and closed his eyes thoughtfully before returning to the pose he had adopted in the beginning. \u201cI imagine you could very well have the grades fixed to your liking with the one hundred million you win. But this will be your first time bribing people in education. I mean, I bet you think just walking up to your professors during their office hours with a briefcase full of cash will be enough?\u201d\n\nMelvin gulped, then nodded slowly. Simon\u2019s smile grew wider before he continued.\n\n\u201cWhile that may work short term, if they don\u2019t decide to report you to the university or the police, which, by the way, would completely fuck up your life and cost you about a quarter of what you win in legal fees.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can vouch for that.\u201d I interjected with a subtle grin. Melvin looked at me funny for a moment. It suddenly occurred to me that he might have no idea who I am, and I apologized quickly before I spoke. \u201cUh, I say that because I\u2019m a lawyer. Criminal lawyers normally charge by the hour, but high profile cases like this-\u201c\n\n\u201cI think he gets it, deadbeat.\u201d Simon said curtly, turning his smile into a choleric expression to look at me. Satisfied by my silence, Simon returned to his friendly visage before speaking to Melvin again. \n\n\u201cOn top of that risk, you\u2019ll still live your life in constant fear. What if one of the professors you bribe has an attack on their conscience and decides to make public what they did for you? Or what if they decide they *have* to explain to their family or significant other where the extra money came from? When that happens, all that money you gave away will be for nothing, and you can bet your ass that the easy life will be gone once again.\u201d\n\nMelvin\u2019s face was now riddled with uncertainty. He leaned forward and rubbed his sweating forehead with a trembling hand. Simon leaned down, grinning a smile that only a demon could possess when making a deal like this.\n\n\u201cI can do it perfectly, Melvin.\u201d Simon said, each syllable articulated with authoritative purpose. \u201cI can make it so that your professor\u2019s won\u2019t lie awake at night questioning what they did. I can make it so that, even if they do, they\u2019ll know better than to say anything about changing your grades. I can make it so they don\u2019t worry about the paper trail coming back to haunt them. I can make it so that, even if your father becomes suspicious, his best efforts will only further the narrative that you were a fantastic student.\u201d\n\nAt the mention of his father, Melvin tensed up. I nearly collapsed from the blast of air that was forced out of his lungs. After his massive exhale, Melvin\u2019s head shot to his left, and his eye\u2019s met Simon\u2019s.\n\n\u201cYou mean that? Even if my dad looks inta this, he won\u2019t find a damn thang?\u201d Melvin\u2019s accent was ridiculously thick now, making me wonder how much thought he put into covering it up on a daily basis. Simon\u2019s grin grew wider, threatening to touch his ears. \n\n\u201cYou have my word that even the entirety of the Finn fortune couldn\u2019t turn a single stone that pointed to your poor academic performance.\u201d\n\nMelvin took in a deep, shaky breath, reminding me that I wasn\u2019t the only one that stood to lose something tonight. Slowly, he turned to me, casting his gaze to the right as he spoke.\n\n\u201cI accept your terms. Your life for my pinky, and we both put twenty thousand in the pot.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright!\u201d I cheered. If I wasn\u2019t so weak, my merriment might have sounded better than the croak of a horny old man who was getting a sponge bath from a buxom young nurse. I had a chance now! The real Shark had taken my bait. The temptation of seeing someone die compelled Simon to push Melvin into a bet he didn\u2019t need to take. More importantly, it was a bet where he never had the opportunity to find out if he had the advantage. I felt a strong hand dig into my shoulder, and I found the source to be a plum complected Clarence.\n\n\u201cLook, I have had a hard enough time sawing off your extremities, but I will *not* kill you!\u201d The anger, sadness, and fear in Clarence\u2019s speech and expression was palpable. He tried to speak again, but just as tears began to roll down his face, I heard a quiet laugh echo throughout the room. I turned to what was causing the sound, and saw Simon laughing with his eyes wide open. Soon, his soft chuckle transformed into a maniacal, sickening cackle. He took in a deep breath before grabbing his handkerchief and glasses, wiping the lenses with the cloth. Placing them back on his face, he turned to one of his suits and spoke.\n\n\u201cTheo, fetch the small purple cooler from the fridge in my room.\u201d\n\nThe suit named Theo quickly shuffled out of the room. As we waited for his return, Simon addressed me directly.\n\n\u201cPerhaps I should have told you this before I convinced Melvin to take this bet, but your medical representative won\u2019t be the one to kill you. That honor belongs to me.\u201d\n\nSimon made artful strides to my side of the table, every step part of his joyous dance. He stood beside me, leaning over until his face was inches from mine.\n\n\u201cTell me, Richard: you might not have an affinity for art, but do you care for history?\u201d\n\nFighting off the urge to gag from the stench of tobacco that emanated from his mouth, I spoke quickly. \n\n\u201cI suppose so.\u201d\n\nSimon rose, standing with a pose so shockingly erect it made me wonder how he could stand to slouch as often as he did. \n\n\u201cThen perhaps you\u2019ll enjoy this story.\u201d Simon reached into his jacket and produced a steel cigarette case. He opened it while motioning for one of the guards to come forward. Putting a cigarette in his mouth, he leaned forward while the guard lit his cigarette. The cherry became a bright orange as he inhaled, and he pulled the cigarette out of his mouth as he spoke.\n\n\u201cDo you know anything about Oskar Dirlewanger?\u201d Smoke trailed from the edges of his lips as he spoke.\n\n\u201cThe name is familiar.\u201d I responded promptly. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t tell you anything about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAllow me to enlighten you.\u201d Simon grinned, putting the cigarette back in his mouth before continuing. \u201cOskar was a German soldier, earning most of his medals during his tenure in the Third Reich. Of course, his rank as a military man is hardly why history remembers him. He was known for being one of the greatest sadists in Hitler\u2019s elite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, he was so sadistic that even his fellow German\u2019s tried their best to have him court-marshalled. While this may have taken place in an earlier Germany or a Germany led by a more sane individual, all efforts to have him removed from his position of power were pointless, as he was held in high regard by everyone\u2019s favorite Fuhrer.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmong other things, rumors about Oskar included using human corpses to make soap, burning barns with people inside, and the rape of Jewish boys. While these and a handful of other rumors remain to be substantiated, two things have been proven to be true about him:\u201d Simon held up a single finger, keeping his wide eyes on me. \u201cOne, that he was a heavy drinker who did things on a whim, and two,\u201d Simon held up his other finger, but didn\u2019t speak. Instead, he turned his head to his left, where his entire demeanor became that of a giddy schoolboy. \n\nThe suit named Theo had returned, and with him a small purple cooler. He set it down before Simon, who eagerly leaned down and popped it open. I saw that a rectangular black box was resting on a bed of ice, and Simon pulled that out of the cooler. He shut the lid of the cooler and placed the black box on top of the cooler. Slowly, methodically, and with overflowing enthusiasm, Simon opened the box and pulled out a large syringe.\n\nThe syringe itself seemed to be quite old-fashioned, in that it had those two rings at the base near the plunger where the operator put their fingers. The needle was long and thick, with the edge of it filed down to a sharp incline. The barrel was filled with a liquid that nearly resembled water in both color and viscosity, save for a slight brown tinge in its color. Simon held the needle close to his face, and turned to me with the smile of a demon.\n\n\u201cThe other thing that was proven about Oskar was his favorite method of killing.\u201d Simon\u2019s eyes turned back to the syringe. He looked at it the way Ana might look at me after I had been gone for a week or two on business: that longing look of love, passion, and lust that only a lover could possess. \u201cHe would often force Jewish women to strip nude before him and be subjected to a beating or get raped by one of his fellow officers or get whipped with a traditional cat-o-nine-tails. And after all that, he\u2019d promise to heal them with his special medicine. In reality, he\u2019d inject them with strychnine.\u201d\n\nI had no idea what strychnine was, but I didn\u2019t imagine it was anything good if it was the weapon of choice for a sadist that even the Nazi\u2019s feared.\n\n\u201cYou see, Oskar loved nothing more than to see people die agonizing deaths, and that\u2019s exactly what strychnine does.\u201d Simon turned his gaze back to me, his eyes glazed over. \u201cIt\u2019s never a pretty death. Normally, people who are affected by strychnine ingest it, and so the symptoms take about ten to fifteen minutes to show up. But when the substance is injected directly into the bloodstream, the symptoms take place almost immediately, about thirty seconds to two minutes after the substance has been injected.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes the victims spasm uncontrollably over and over again. Their body does this, contorting in painful and dreadfully unrealistic ways, until the victim dies of exhaustion or their brain simply makes them forget how to breathe. The incredible, violent nature of the spasms can even cause bones to break! And the best part?\u201d Simon paused, slowly grinding his teeth in unadulterated excitement. He leaned forward, his mouth practically touching my ear, and spoke in a voice so gravely and demented that I felt as if it belonged to Satan.\n\n\u201cIt takes about two to three hours for the victim to die. And they\u2019re awake the entire time.\u201d Simon pulled away, his grin unfading. He constantly shifted his gaze back and forth between the syringe and my only arm. He stood up, giggling uncontrollably as he stroked my arm.\n\n\u201cHere!\u201d He said enthusiastically. \u201cI\u2019ll prick you here and watch you die a horrible death! I\u2019ll witness your demise in mere moments! I\u2019ll see the greatest death that exists! I\u2019ll-\u201c\n\n\u201cAre. You. Done. Yet?\u201d\n\nSimon let go of my arm and turned to face me. I knew my voice didn\u2019t sound much better than it did earlier, but somehow I had found the lingering spirit of the lawyer I once was within me, and I had spoken as if I was in the courtroom. I maintained my smile.\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Simon\u2019s grin transformed into a malicious scowl.\n\n\u201cYou heard me.\u201d I quipped, feeling my own smile grow. \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear your fantasies about a man who enjoyed diddling kids in yarmulkes.\u201d\n\nI saw Simon\u2019s grip on the syringe tighten, and I silently hoped that he busted the thing open. If I lost, at least I\u2019d get one final laugh at seeing him struggle to find a new horrid way to kill me. \n\n\u201cBesides, my death hasn\u2019t been guaranteed yet.\u201d I was impressed with myself: I never knew I could be THIS brave in such a bad situation. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you wait until the cards show up to decide how I die, Nazi boy?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know which part of the little name I gave him infuriated him more, but the rage in Simon\u2019s face was hot enough to boil water. He shot his neck to the right and looked directly at the dealer.\n\n\u201cHernandez! Hurry up and deal them in!\u201d\n\nThe dealer, who had been yelled at all night, still complied, shuffling the cards with efficiency I didn\u2019t know he had.\n\nThis is it. This is do or die. The last big bet: my life against the pinky of the kid of some tobacco tycoon.\n\nHere goes everything! Ronnie, if you can hear me: I\u2019m truly going all in!\n\n***\n\nWhew!
